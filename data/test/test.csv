0,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It’s a comic-fantasy that gets a passing grade, but not a high one. What’s weird is that is actually a high score for the Warner Brothers brand of comic-book movies."
1,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Aquaman has some truly original imagery and a matching score to boot. If only the writing had been as imaginative.
2,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is the fun action-packed, adventure movie we’ve sorely been needing from the DCEU. I’m happy with how they developed the character and hope to see more of him. I highly recommend you see this on the big screen."
3,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"The production and attention to detail here is next level. ... Every character in this film is a bada--. Try and make Aquaman a punchline now, after this movie."
4,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"“Aquaman” is an oddly satisfying blast. It’s nothing groundbreaking or highly original, but it is a movie that embraces its weirdness in a way I really appreciated."
5,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,Watching it is like seeing an expensive accident unfold.
6,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It's comic awesomeness, but I think people are going to question whether the central battle should have been with his younger brother versus Manta."
7,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,The film isn't exactly subtle - it possesses the restraint of a broken fire hydrant. But that's part of the appeal.
8,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"The movie does have its engaging and serious moments, but for the most part, I feel that they managed to not take themselves too seriously, which was appreciated."
9,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It isn't a complete win, but the film pays off in big ways and achieves what many would have thought impossible: It elevates Aquaman into the top tier of superheroes."
10,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Wan decorates every frame with eyeball entertainment that grasps the sublime and the silly of the ""Aquamen"" origin story."
11,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"More style than substance, Aquaman is wonderful visually, but presents too much that we've seen before, often in the form of lazy writing."
12,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"An all-out assault on the senses, Aquaman is an overstuffed superhero flick that doesn't take itself too seriously, but also has no clue as to when and how to rein things in."
13,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"After a somewhat underwhelming introduction in Zack Snyder's Justice League, DC's aquatic hero Arthur Curry returns for his first solo big-screen outing in James Wan's Aquaman, and the results are... not good."
14,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Literally a fish out of water movie, 'Aquaman' is a fun and ridiculous underwater ride..."
15,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"A shirtless Momoa, repeatedly striking a poster-worthy pose, simply isn't an effective way to generate an emotional investment."
16,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Aquaman isn't quite a true dud, courtesy of cotton candy visuals that are least a lot of fun to watch."
17,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Epic, weird and comic booky. Aquaman revitalizes the DCEU in ways no one ever saw coming. [Full review in Spanish]"
18,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"We get but a glimpse of what Aquaman could've been oncewe plunge into Atlantis, but its world-building is all too passive, zipping past its most unique aspects."
19,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Comic-book fans will find it entertaining enough to stay afloat, non-fans will start drowning and the rest of us will be tired from treading water."
20,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"So does it give you your money's worth? Yes, if you look at the brighter side of things."
21,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is not great -- it's barely even good -- but it's a great deal of silly, preposterous, splashy fun, with a fascinating degree of world-building that is rarely seen outside of the Star Wars universe or higher-end animated films."
22,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"This is a rip roaring, hilariously goofy movie that is nothing short of entertaining throughout its two and a half hour runtime."
23,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"A Day-Glo, candy-colored, hallucinogenic seascape that resembles the cover of an epic adventure metal album from the '80s. And it's as fun and messy as that sounds."
24,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"[T]hat the locales are announced via subtitle, often before the characters ... know where they are, evokes the levels and stages of an adventure game. [T]hat's what [it] is."
25,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is not only a surprisingly fun adventure film, but it's also a huge leap forward for the flailing DCEU."
26,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"It gives me a feeling that I only find when I see the fishes in the fish tank or in the aquarium, where nothing relevant happens for two and a half eternally long hours and the fishes transform into disposable plastic characters. [Full review in Spanish]"
27,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"A glimmer of hope for the troubled DCU, Aquaman is a way better than a film about a superhero who talks to fishes has any right to be."
28,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,It felt like eight different movies.
29,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,It's a solid hour too long. I felt like I was in the theater for days.
30,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Non-existent believability isn't always a problem, but the rest of the skeleton that the film hangs on needs to be entertaining."
31,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Overall, Aquaman is everything it needs to be in order to succeed. It looks great, it's a ton of fun, and the action sequences are truly a step forward in terms of merging coherence with cinematic show-offery."
32,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Watching it feels like eating 10 boxes of Junior Mints while drinking a 64-ounce Icee. It cements the idea of a DC Cinematic Universe that people actually enjoy, and also the end of human sanity."
33,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"In a time that continues to place comic book superheroes in a class that's all their own, Aquaman can now stand tall as well, even if there's a little ocean spray back."
34,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"When the cast isn't aimlessly drifting from port to port, they're swimming in a soup of phantasmagoria that's both intoxicating and exhausting."
35,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Each of Aquaman's flaws, are complimented by brilliant action-sequences, stylish swagger, and an epic, massive adventure, like the character himself."
36,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Aquaman seems to have thrown out the seriousness and embrace the fantastical elements of the superhero through eye-catching visuals and ambitious special effects.
37,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is an entertaining film, with fantastic world building, fun humor and thrilling, well-directed action sequences."
38,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,The dumb parts of the movie are the best parts of the movie. I wish it had leaned into being more dumb.
39,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"An absolute triumph, Aquaman is a blast to watch start to finish and one of this year's best superhero movies. Bring on the sequel because another Jason Momoa/James Wan team-up is an even more exciting prospect than the Justice League re-assembling!"
40,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"This film tries to be super cool, but it just isn't camp enough to be good."
41,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"The movie raises serious environmental issues, and then, rather than engaging with them, it shows us lots of fight scenes."
42,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Somehow, Warner Bros produced an Aquaman movie wilder and more epic than the one Vinnie Chase starred in on ""Entourage,"" and they didn't even need to get James Cameron to do it."
43,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,If you are a Momoa or DC comics fan you will be pleased to know that this Aquaman is a quality version and won't disappoint even the most skeptical amongst us.
44,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Aquaman is a stunning spectacle and Jason Momoa is a blast to watch from beginning to end.
45,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Nicole Kidman kills a TV with a trident. Black Manta yells ""Call me Black Manta!"" Ocean Master yells ""Call me Ocean Master!"" Aquaman yells ""I am Aquaman!"" If you take a shot every time someone does a superhero landing, your liver turns into a puffer fish."
46,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Move over, Marvel. CNET's Bonnie Burton explains why the new Aquaman movie made her a DC fan."
47,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"This film is everything, but most of all it's a deliberate confection. It's instinctively and immediately silly."
48,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,The action sequences are just so gleefully bonkers that one can't help but get swept up in it.
49,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,If you're willing to surrender to what [James] Wan has created in the depths of his CGI ocean then you're potentially in for a delirious ride of entertaining lunacy.
50,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Aquaman was a film that could have been great, but fell flat. The amazing CGI did not make up for the cheesey jokes and what felt like a dumbed down script."
51,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Splash meets Game of Thrones in this thoroughly entertaining slice of submersible superheroics.
52,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,Another lump of coal in the DC Extended Universe stocking. Unnecessarily loud and horribly written.
53,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"After wallowing in darkness for far too long, DC embraces some relatively lighter fun in its latest superhero adventure, Aquaman."
54,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Once in a while, Momoa lets out a gut laugh or barbaric yawp that cements him as that rare thing, a king you want to have a beer with. A king and a fool -- a Falstaff with a six-pack."
55,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is not a flawlessly constructed film but takes the DCEU in a welcome direction, enthralling with stunning visuals and grounding itself in humanity."
56,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Somehow, James Wan manages to pull it off, creating a film that not only refuses to apologize for adhering to its roots, but fully embraces the inherent absurdity that comes from trying to bring these characters to life in a realistic setting."
57,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,Aquaman is forgettable and average.
58,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Hardcore fans of Peter David's take on the character may enjoy this movie... for the rest of the world, James Wan's adaptation is cringy and barely watchable. [Full review in Spanish]"
59,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"As many similarities it has with other properties, Aquaman has this infectious confidence that makes it difficult not to like."
60,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,The film's simple-mindedness makes it work.
61,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,...could have used more octopus percussionists.
62,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Nothing about this movie works. It is way too obvious, it's got cheesy special effects, it feels like a 1980's film with the jokes, and it's trying too hard."
63,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"The best way to define it is like ""the Schrödinger movie"": a film that is at the same time between the best and the worst. [Full Review in Spanish]"
64,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,One of DC's first genuinely fun and entertaining films. [Full Review in Spanish]
65,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"This film knows exactly what kind of film it is, right down to Wan showing off Momoa's on-screen smolder by playing a snippet of rockin' metal whenever he enters the scene."
66,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"One indeed comes away from Aquaman interested in what further aquatic adventures may yet be in store, with or without any of his Justice League teammates by his side."
67,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman does nothing to subvert or expand its genre, but as superhero movies go, this is one of those that's worth watching for the sheer pleasure of it."
68,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Aquaman is a success. The film makes the most out of its fine cast and psychedelic imagery and remembers to have some fun along with the world building.
69,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Aquaman shows that someone at DC finally learned the most important lesson of superhero films: no one wants to spend over two hours in a theater with a bunch of characters they wouldn't go to get beers with.
70,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"With Aquaman, the character, being one of the rare highlights of Justice League, it's reassuring to see Aquaman, the movie, build upon the half-human, half-Atlantean's momentum."
71,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"DC have doubled down after the muted reaction to Justice League and thrown everything at the wall, and most of it sticks."
72,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Throughout, Aquaman maintains a level of eye-popping visuals and crazy spectacle that always keeps things interesting."
73,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It takes a long, long time for Aquaman to find its feet or fins and swim on course. But when it does, the DC film soars high. What Wan lacks with storytelling, he makes up with action and captivating visuals."
74,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"It's a straightforward and pretty undemanding plot, stretched unnecessarily over two hours and 23 minutes, and the only depth the film has is the ocean."
75,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Not only sets the DC Films universe back on course, but it also introduces a new bona fide movie star in Jason Mamoa."
76,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is a goofy, fun time if you don't think too hard."
77,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Aquaman is an ambitious film but one that isn't afraid of being campy while being committed as an action-packed underwater adventure.
78,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,Quite possibly the worst comic book movie ever made...
79,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Like much of the movie, it doesn't really make sense but you just go with the flow and enjoy the ride."
80,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Plot-wise, the result is a hot, foamy mess, my friends, but a mess that washed over me like a tidal wave."
81,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"There are a lot of structural problems in this movie, some things that are a little too long...but it's also a very fun movie to watch, and it exceeded all of my expectations."
82,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It's definitely worth the watch, and I do think that the best way to experience this movie would be on the biggest screen possible. I don't think that 3D would be necessary either."
83,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,It's a hoot.
84,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It's a fun movie, a little long, but the pacing of the action is actually pretty good..."
85,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Action, romance and adventure: It's all here in 'Aquaman.'"
86,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Aquaman has to rely on its visual wonder, as the script is rather rough-shod with some of the worst dialogue I can remember from these capes and tights exercises"
87,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,It's certainly more entertaining and competent than most of the previous DCEU films but that makes its silly missteps and bloated plot all the more frustrating.
88,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman may be the movie Arthur Curry's alter-ego deserves, an epic spectacle of ludicrous joy that's as dreadfully terrible as it is thrilling."
89,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"It's not the greatest superhero film, but it's not the worst, and everything it has to offer has been done better."
90,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"If Aquaman breezes past philosophical dilemmas to get right to the mayhem, at least Wan and company commit to said mayhem 100 percent."
91,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,Its infrequent shots of fun aren't worth the headache.
92,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,Too much going on; too little of it matters.
93,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"With the game cast, a charismatic lead performance by Jason Mamoa, the electrifying visuals and the infectiously fun tone, Aquaman is a cinematic wave you will want to catch."
94,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,It's a step in the right direction [for Warner Bros. and the DC Extended Universe.] There's just a few kinks to be worked out before the inevitable sequel.
95,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,[Jason Momoa] makes the movie really fun to watch.
96,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"I like Aquaman. I'm not saying it's a great movie or that it's the savior of the DC cinematic universe, but it is a lot of fun."
97,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"All in all it's not great, but it's not terrible. Better than Thor 2, I will say that, but I feel like this is one of those movies I'll forget the plot of."
98,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,Aquaman appears to have everything except rhythm or a clear vision. [Full Review in Spanish]
99,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"With big battles and complex lore, it clearly wants to be an underwater Lord of the Rings, but instead ends up closer to Phantom Menace territory, with some tonally incoherent splashes of Fast and Furious."
100,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Hollywood has given us the greatest, goofiest holiday gift in a long time."
101,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It may not give Marvel any sleepless nights, but this watery adventure seems destined to be a crowd-pleaser."
102,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,a serviceable entry that is worth dipping one's toes back into the DC cinematic waters
103,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Overall, it's not top-notch quality, but a goofy film with a goofy protagonist, a visually stunning world and fun action sequences."
104,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman's faults are very marked, but its virtues are impressive and manages to create an entertaining experience. [Full Review in Spanish]"
105,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,There were some cringe-worthy acting moments in this movie...that's due to the script more so than the actors themselves.
106,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Cheesy and ridiculous, but also a surprising amount of fun."
107,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Kinda fun, mostly due to Momoa's charisma and presence, and the underlying sense of levity. Aquaman doesn't suck any more, but he definitely needs a better vehicle than this."
108,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,A fast-paced free-for-all with fantastic special effects and a solid story about a troubled young man who finds himself the last hope for two worlds.
109,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"...naturally overlong, overblown and sopping wet with CG effects."
110,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Aquaman is fun. It's a lot of fun! Especially if you are willing to shut your brain off and enjoy the movie on the level it is intended.
111,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,What follows is a straightforward superhero adventure - but it is all heightened by a couple of standout factors.
112,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,Aquaman's script is plodding and lacking the emotional weight or character development it needs to draw the viewer in
113,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Momoa, Kidman, Wilson and others are there to service the script, even when it gets cheesy, and it does get cheesy indeed, but the film's warmheartedness and clarity of purpose win out in the end."
114,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is dumb and loud and really dumb and too long and dumb but also wonderfully creative and shameless; it's both the superhero film we need, and the one we deserve."
115,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Momoa was terrific in the role, and even though it's peculiar that the DCEU is doing things in reverse, we've finally arrived at his time to shine in a solo film."
116,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman actually breaks the dour DC mold and delivers a gonzo, highly inventive piece of entertainment that has a surprisingly fresh vision overseen by director James Wan."
117,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Aquaman, as directed by James Wan and reconceived by Warners executives chasing after Marvel's jackpot, is all about copycat desperation -- and shrillness."
118,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"A fish-folk tale making a spectacle of itself... mindless and muddled with glimmers of grandeur. In truth, Aquaman's appeal is strictly tied to Momoa's enthusiasm: it's infectiously sexy."
119,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,This action movie has a fair amount of humor in it. Jason Momoa seems to embody the right combination of imposing physique and jovial good nature to pull this off.
120,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Aquaman is far too long, constantly undercutting its charm in service to derivative action sequences that lose all appeal by the third act."
121,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Through it all, Jason Momoa... tosses off coyly bluff one-liners with understated humor that goes to waste in this bloated and sludgy movie."
122,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,A film that luxuriates in all of the absolute dumbest nonsense of superhero comics.
123,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Jason Momoa is perfectly cast as the DC action hero but the movie is not as good as he is. Too long, too many repetitive fight scenes, and just a general dragginess to the whole thing."
124,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"When Dolph Lundgren riding a giant seahorse is the least crazy thing in a movie, you know it's taking you to some outrageous places."
125,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Aquaman is filled with incredible sequences. [Full Review in Spanish]
126,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,The special-effects (especially in the all-important underwater environment) never quite pack the wow-factor expected from a massive $225 million production.
127,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"[James] Wan definitely took the opportunity to lean into the campiness and Momoa's innate sense of humor, and that's not necessarily a bad thing."
128,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman does everything we expect a big-budget superhero movie to do, but it also remembers to have a heart, a sense of humour – and to give us a real reason to cheer him on."
129,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Aquaman offers two and a quarter hours of pure and simple escape. [Full review in Spanish]
130,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,The director knows what he has in hand and makes the most of it. [Full review in Spanish]
131,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Two and a half hours literally submerged in a giant fish tank where, except for common sense, everything floats. [Full Review in Spanish]"
132,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,But the real star of Aquaman is its director. [Full review in Spanish]
133,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"I do not have a single reason to recommend Aquaman or its Atlantic or oceanic din, despite its good intentions to denounce the seas' ecological disorder [caused by] human beings. [Full review in Spanish]"
134,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Veteran cinematographer Don Burgess's widescreen images beguile, and Bill Brzeski's production design impresses mightily, but next time, someone please give Momoa and company some memorable dialogue."
135,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is rough around the edges but nevertheless an enjoyably silly ride that unabashedly embraces the cheesiness and weirdness of its world and runs -- er, swims -- with it at full speed."
136,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Offers something that suddenly seems revolutionary -- a superhero movie for... comic book fans. Nearly every exaggerated, Day-Glo frame feels like it was pulled from a hand-drawn panel."
137,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"While  Wonder Woman  reveled in the intimacy of Themyscira,  Aquaman  and director James Wan paints the largest picture possible."
138,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It's campy and miles over the top, but fun in its loopy wouldn't-it-be-cool-to-breathe-under-water way."
139,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"See it on the big screen for a fun, beautiful, underwater ride. Just don't expect too much in terms of story and acting."
140,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Aquaman is super fun when it embraces its silliness-there's an octopus that plays the drums! There's an army of cranky crab-men!-but by the end, it just feels bloated and squishy."
141,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It may not be coherent, but as far as messes go, Aquaman is certainly one of Hollywood's more watchable ones."
142,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Entertainment value limited to humor and big visual mastery, ""Aquaman"" does mark forward progress for the DC universe."
143,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"As the equivalent of a Jason Momoa pinup calendar, Aquaman rates four stars. As a superhero film, this soggy enterprise merits decidedly less."
144,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"A superhero origin story with an aquatic Avatar, Star Wars war and Indiana Jones treasure-hunt adventure rolled into one. It makes a seaworthy splash amidst all the superhero fares. A swimmingly rollicking, action-packed fantasy adventure."
145,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"The fix is easy: Mo Momoa, Fewer Problems."
146,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"A movie where budding romance, rising palace intrigue, and swash-buckling adventure take a back seat to the quiet glee of watching a team of gifted visual effects artists recreate the aesthetic of a Lisa Frank trapper keeper on a giant IMAX screen."
147,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"With charismatic leads and some sublime visuals that overpower the ridiculous, Aquaman is DC's second good movie and first real statement piece since 2013."
148,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is an underwater spectacle that wholeheartedly embraces its comic book roots, from the costumes to the cheesiness."
149,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Any excitement audiences expected from director James Wan, who has helped reinvigorate the horror genre with The Conjuring series, will wonder if perhaps his success is limited to blood baths and jump scares."
150,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"If there was one film to sum up the hit-and-mostly-miss nature of the DCEU, it's Aquaman."
151,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Exciting, visually stunning underwater lore..."
152,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,A thoroughly entertaining ride.
153,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,One of the most wildly imaginative and purely fun blockbusters of the year.
154,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"If the series is going to fully recover from Zack Snyder's early assault, it will have to better marry brains with brawn, resisting the false choice of Wan's salty blow out."
155,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,It's such a mess not even a fine performance by Jason Momoa as the shirtless and trident wielding good-ol'-superhero can rescue it from the bottom of the sea.
156,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Through it all Momoa's muscle ripple as the camera objectifies his beauty in a way that is usually restricted to women.
157,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Take one cliché from every comic book movie of the past decade, put them in a blender, then throw that blender into the ocean. Boom. You've got yourself an Aquaman movie."
158,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Hunky, self-deprecating Jason Momoa is more of an Aqua Dude buoyed by a riotous deluge of dazzling visuals that refresh the DC universe."
159,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"We have another movie about a biracial hero coming to terms with his place in the world, a superhero film that enthusiastically embraces its more ludicrous tropes, and a sprawling epic that makes the movies of the DCEU worth watching again."
160,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman dares to be its own beast. And with a charismatic hero at its center to bridge the divide, DC remembers playfulness can actually be a boon."
161,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is goofy and messy and sprawling, hyperactive and jokey ... but it isn't bleak. It is unabashedly itself, and by not taking itself so seriously, it allows room for some actual fun."
162,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Ultimately, like much of the DCEU, Aquaman just can't make things work. While there's a definite sense of humor behind the film, it doesn't take things far enough."
163,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Director James Wan is not concerned with shoehorning his film into the greater DCEU, which gives him the freedom to make a film that rolls Aquaman's origin story and an exciting plot into a movie that surpasses most of the studio's other efforts."
164,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Sorry Charlie, 'Aquaman' is a blast."
165,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is so unapologetically over-the-top, its madness is undeniably entertaining."
166,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Generating some modest thrills with minimal genuine suspense, the film dives deep visually while emotionally remaining on the surface."
167,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"A refreshing, fast-moving, visually inventive adventure that actually has some heart at the heart of all the epic battle scenes...though Aquaman honours superhero movie conventions it largely avoids that stale formulaic feel we're often forced to endure."
168,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"But oh, those action sequences: this is what the Tron sequel should have looked and sounded like."
169,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Had this movie arrived as recently as two years ago, it might have been heralded as a higher-end superhero movie. Things have changed, however, in both the DCEU and the MCU."
170,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"The bright spots (Momoa, that octopus) can be difficult to really relish amid the oceans of exposition and a typically pulverizing, overelaborate screenplay."
171,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,One just has to throw up one's fins and give in to the ridiculousness.
172,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman breaks the mould. It's an authentically light-hearted brand of rubbish, taking a tongue-in-cheek delight in its own absurdity."
173,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman gives Warner Bros. another base hit for the DCEU, but it might have been better served by making it a Mera-centric film with Aquaman as a supporting player."
174,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"It's wildly uneven, tonally all over the map, and clogs the screen with special effects that range from pretty great to pretty bad. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
175,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"In making the first DC superhero film in a long time to aspire to anything like levity, Wan finds a way to catalyze what might have been yet another dust-dry origin story."
176,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"As brain-dead fun, this movie is smarter than you think."
177,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"The world-building here is definitely the best of any non-Wonder Woman DCEU film, the action sequences are first-rate, and unlike in Zack Snyder's Superman films, there's actually sunlight."
178,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"All in all, it amounts to the most campy DC outing since Joel Schumacher helmed a couple of Batman movies in the '90s. That's not a recommendation."
179,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"There's plenty of visual invention on display, but the eye can't totally silence a question from the mind: How much underwater spectacle does an Aquaman movie need before we start to drown in it?"
180,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,There are so many unnecessary CGI blowups cluttering the movie that Mera's chemistry with Arthur doesn't get the oxygen it needs to ignite the love affair Aquaman wants us to believe in.
181,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman isn't all dumb fighting and arguing among sea-guys. The movie's biggest selling points are its affable, bear-hug spirit and its lavish, loopy visuals."
182,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Beautifully silly and tons of fun.
183,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,There are parts of Aquaman that are so wonderfully strange that it's astonishing to see them in a franchise blockbuster.
184,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,It's all eye candy for the viewer. The production designers have outdone themselves.
185,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Not all comic book characters have unsolvable mommy issues and sometimes embracing the cheese is a relief.
186,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman doesn't get close to the triumph of Wonder Woman, but at least it's a step in the right direction of creating a unique, vivid, and at times escapist superhero movie."
187,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"The costuming is on point and the visuals of the film are amazing. Atlantis, in particular, feels like an underwater Pandora and is a feast for the eyes. Where the wheels start falling off is continuity, scriptwriting and use of characters."
188,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is the king of the seas, just put your brain on pause and let the movie wash over you."
189,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,This movie is a theme park ride... while it's fun it has really no big emotional impact.
190,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,It's the world of Exposition.
191,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"This time the origin story is under the sea in a fight for dynasty, but Aquaman is unable to disembark from the kitsch weight that is characteristically DC. [Full Review in Spanish]"
192,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"There are some impressive battle sequences but a few too many moments of poor CGI, making it feel like you are watching a cartoon or someone playing a video game at times."
193,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Even graced with the charming company of Momoa and Nicole Kidman, who is having a blast playing his high-kicking, otherworldly mother, the timing and tone of this movie is consistently off."
194,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"While its stunning visuals and underwater combat make it a vast improvement over many of the other DCEU films, an overcrowded story and campy dialogue make it far more exhausting than exciting."
195,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"The screenplay must have had the line ""suddenly, they are interrupted by an explosion"" copied and pasted randomly several times throughout."
196,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"DC Comics' oceanic superhero gets his own movie, but star Jason Momoa isn't enough of a screen presence to carry the weight."
197,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Either the best bad movie or the worst good movie of 2018.
198,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Momoa, while amiable, is like a handsome stuntman. He and Heard cannot carry the film. Derivative action. Creatures from menu at Red Lobster."
199,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Because it is entertaining, ""Aquaman"" can rest comfortably as the second best film in the DCEU."
200,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Wan's descent into comic book fantasia is close to incredible, even its frequent missteps overflowing in an infectious giddy fervor that's close to wonderful."
201,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"With the world the way it's going, it's not surprising people would rather watch a buffed guy swim with dolphins. But with so many resources spent on it, this is one underwater adventure that dries out fast."
202,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,It was only about 20 minutes into Aquaman that I heard the unmistakable sound of a movie taking on water... Titanic didn't go down this fast.
203,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,Is there anything hugely wrong with Aquaman? Not really. Is this a missed opportunity? Yes.
204,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Aquaman works because it isn't laughing at itself-it's both joyously whimsical and confident in its own sea-worthiness.
205,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"I can recommend Aquaman as a fun couple of hours in the theatre. It isn't going to re-write cinema or anything, but I do think it keeps DC in the running for being able to produce an enjoyable movie that entertains fans and casual watchers alike."
206,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"There aren't enough drumming octopi to make this movie memorable, an observation I thought I'd never have to make."
207,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Take a dehumidifier to ""Aquaman,"" and after all the water evaporates, what's left is a garden-variety superhero movie."
208,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Just plain fun, and manages to establish the franchise as a solid pillar to stand alongside Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman."
209,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"While DCEU heroes like Henry Cavill's Superman and Ben Affleck's Batman were unbearably solemn, it is easy to see that Momoa is having a blast in the lead role."
210,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"You lift, Dude Bro? Cuz this ship is sinking..."
211,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Only Julie Andrews voicing a sea monster, a CGI octopus playing eight drums at the same time, and Roy Orbison's ""She's a Mystery to Me,"" which backs a video-like tribute to Curry's blooming love interest (Amber Heard), gurgle up anything memorable."
212,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"CGI action fans will be awestruck by the special effects which dominate Aquaman, a must-see in 3-D."
213,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"The underwater world is CGI at its most smothering-your eyes cry out for air, for tangibility. Everything is weightless and yet oppressive, like a sheet tangled around a drowning human body."
214,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"For some it might be an acquired taste, but it succeeds by pairing simplistic narrative ambitions with an authentically wild visual experience."
215,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Sure, it's memorable, but it's far too unwieldy to be effective."
216,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It's predictable yet fun; it's a worthy hero origin, but being that it's this good for a hero so heavily chided for so long, it feels like even more of an accomplishment."
217,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"As superhero origin stories go, it's actually an improvement over most of the movies based on DC comics."
218,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"...it's a more memorable movie than most of the lesser Marvel films, and thus, DC takes another step toward righting the ship."
219,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Aquaman is not really a bad movie by DC's standards, but it is the weirdest thing they've made in recent years by a country mile - and not always in a good way."
220,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"The film's hyperkinetic nature makes it impossible to be less than entertained. But because Aquaman is always go, go, go, there's not much room for character development."
221,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Halfway through the waterlogged kookiness that is Aquaman, I half expected the title character to announce that he lived in a pineapple under the sea."
222,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It's a Saturday morning cartoon with an insane budget. The visual effects are stunning, but there are a lot of narrative and pacing issues...the movie saves itself continuously with phenomenal action sequences."
223,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"I think the movie is fun. For some reason, some people can't accept it...when can ""fun"" not be an acceptable way to describe a movie?"
224,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It brings across that feeling of how deep, dark and mysterious the sea is."
225,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"There was no theme, ultimately, but the music did help move the movie along..."
226,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,Even Arthur seems to know this is all 'find the maguffin and save the world' but the film can't have that much fun with it. The screenwriters have to play through the typical save the world/fulfill your destiny plot with predictable twists.
227,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"The latest movie from the DC Universe is an embarrassing shamble that is highlighted by clunky dialogue, characters who constantly shout their dialogue and hackneyed CGI special effects that look as if interns created them."
228,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Like the title character, the movie is nice to look but does itself a disservice by speaking."
229,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"[Aquaman's] delightful silliness does point to what these movies should have been doing all along: standing alone, rather than trying to reconcile the weird worlds of its various heroes for premature team-ups."
230,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"[A]s soon as [James] Wan's able to free the beast at ... the film's midway point, Aquaman realizes its potential as a show-stopping blockbuster oddity."
231,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"While Aquaman is one of the better DC films, it is still fairly uneven. It gives us a glimpse at a whole new mythos and makes the world of Atlantis feel ancient, creating a fantasy story that offers something different for DC fans"
232,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,When you're riding a damn shark into war and there's an octopus playing drums and also Nicole Kidman is there? I wouldn't say no.
233,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,A fantastic display of Big Trident Energy that's more than happy to attempt beating you into submission.
234,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,The wow factor is gone - it's a bubbly undersea yawn.
235,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Aquaman mostly ignores establishing, let alone developing or evolving, its eponymous superhero in any meaningful way."
236,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,A colorfully over-the-top comic book adventure that overcomes tonal stumbles and some iffy CG with pure charisma and fun.
237,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,One of the most enjoyable movies in the so-called DC Universe...its cheeky sense of humor and striking visuals make it a better-than-average example of the genre.
238,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"None of it makes a ripple of sense, even when blown up to IMAX 3D size."
239,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Momoa might nail the everyman end of the spectrum, with copious beer guzzling and manly hair flipping, but he doesn't invest this dude with much regal leadership potential."
240,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Like the Star Wars prequels, like Avatar, it's a movie with tons of problems, but it also contains images that made me catch my breath - gorgeous and even numinous sights I will remember forever."
241,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Big in every way , but fortunately not ALL wet thanks to a lively Jason Momoa and some terrific underwater visual effects."
242,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,It swims more than it sinks.
243,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Wan has a great visual eye or, at very least, a master's degree in CGI."
244,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"James Wan's Aquaman has way too much going on. It's all three Lord of the Rings underwater, with a grand finale giant fish war that's like the largest tureen of bouillabaisse ever cooked."
245,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"A strong, effective story that makes the Aquaman character feel like a genuinely big deal... A triumph. Go and see this big 'n' loud as soon as you possibly can."
246,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,It is far too silly to be taken seriously and far too plodding to work as some kind of oddball oddity. It never sinks to the depths (sorry) of a complete misfire... but it just never clicks.
247,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,The underwater action-adventure picks the most over-the-top elements of James Wan's directorial style and mixes it with cartoonish CGI and 80s comic-book madness for a laughably bad end result.
248,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It took a while, but the DC Extended Universe finally has embraced the inherent silliness of superheroes."
249,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Check your brain at the door, and you should mostly enjoy its 143 minutes."
250,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"For all its wild spectacle and cartoon cleverness, this is a quietly subversive movie, and an evolutionary step forward for the genre."
251,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"[Jason] Momoa's made for this sort of over-the-top action role and if we can't have him back romancing Khaleesi and leading the Dothraki, then an Aquaman outing will just have to suffice."
252,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Visually spectacular with an exquisite aqua colour palette, the film is an inventive and immersive underwater fantasy firmly anchored by its larger than life star, Jason Momoa."
253,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"""Aquaman"" is weird and corny and fun, but it would have been more fun if the weirdness and corniness had been dialed up to 11."
254,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is the increasingly rare superhero movie that's also a star vehicle, as well as being one hell of a triumph for its director."
255,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It's as splashy, action-packed and utterly bonkers as you'd expect a story about a fishy fella who can save the world would be."
256,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"What ultimately holds it together is that this film is self-aware about its silliness, to the point that it is often sublime."
257,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"The periodic bursts of creativity and weirdness can't fully hide the fact that this superhero epic doesn't offer anything new. It's mostly fun, but could have been way better."
258,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"You're just waiting for the wild final act, when Wan fully embraces the metal promises of this Aquaman concept, and we get to witness Arthur fighting fishmonsters and Mera straddling an Orca as she rides into a psychedelic subaquatic battle."
259,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"... from beginning to end, Aquaman is big dumb fun. It doesn't dare take itself seriously, and it's a better movie for it."
260,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,It looks as if we've finally got what we've long asked for: a superhero with the looks and attitude of a forgiving bouncer in a Venice Beach heavy metal bar.
261,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Not even an up-for-anything Jason Momoa can save Aquaman from being a joke. Still, the fun is a relief after all the recent DCEU superhero gloom. Any fish epic that finds time to show us an octopus playing bongos gets a pass in our book."
262,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Whatever the case, Aquaman falls into an uncomfortable try-hard dead zone that leaves it in better shape than, say, Batman v. Superman or Suicide Squad, but just shy of the gleefully anarchic predecessors... like Jupiter Ascending."
263,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"At times, the plot feels like the 12 Labors of Hercules, with a couple of extra labors thrown in just for the heck of it."
264,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"The saving grace of director James Wan's great-looking and reasonably entertaining but also meandering and sometimes truly ridiculous Aquaman is that everyone from screenwriters through the talented cast seems to get the sheer, waterlogged lunacy..."
265,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"...so utterly entertaining, wickedly inventive, and insanely paced that it comes spinning into cinemas like a breath of fresh ocean air."
266,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"This movie is really entertaining -- a lot of fun! But it's also ""a lot,"" period."
267,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Aquaman is so exquisitely tailored to and fitted around the outsized personality and impressive form of Jason Momoa that it's almost impossible to distinguish star from vehicle from character.
268,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"If Aquaman has anything going for it, it's the fact that it fully embraces just how ridiculous it is."
269,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"It's just two and a half years of - sorry, two and a half hours - of oceanic screen savers and hair that won't stop undulating so we know when we're underwater."
270,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"It seems director James Wan had one overarching goal in making ""Aquaman."" His prime directive? Crush the audience into submission."
271,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Playing like a modern-day parody of '80s fantasy films like Clash of the Titans, Aquaman embraces the camp, the zany, and the weird."
272,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Wan swings for the fences in crafting arguably the most ambitious comic book film we've seen on the big screen yet.
273,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"A big dumb acid-trip of a super-hero movie - relentless, noisy, entertaining nonsense, with trippy sight gags like a drum-playing octopus and a wedding dress made of jellyfish."
274,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"While Momoa is just fine as the titular ""Aquaman,"" [the] screenplay features far too little humor and far too much origin story - by the time Orm's visiting those remaining undersea realms, they feel like jammed in afterthoughts."
275,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It's big and splashy, a visual feast with real stakes, but also with an earnestness it wears proudly on its sleeve."
276,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Released fifteen years ago, this flick would have been a good enough romp to pass the time. Now, however, with the advent of so many incredible superhero ventures, Aquaman just feels stagnant."
277,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Obviously, there are some negatives here. Still, AQUAMAN is a hard movie not to recommend. It is often funny, has a good heart, and its star proves incredibly endearing."
278,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"[Momoa] clearly knows he cannot take the subject matter too seriously, and there is always that wink, smirk and devil-may-care attitude that makes him rather charming."
279,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"James Wan has thrown everything he can think of on the screen, but the best special effect in this extravaganza is Jason Momoa's hair."
280,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"The film is indeed a little stronger in story and character than some of its predecessors in the DCEU have been, but it still has a long list of problems all its own to contend with."
281,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Is it too long? Yeah, probably. Does it contradict some of the things we learned about Aquaman in the Justice League movie? Nothing important. The elements that work far outweigh the ones that don't."
282,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"A visual and audio symphony by James Wan, which takes VFX storytelling - and the DCEU - to a whole new level. This movie has to be seen to be believed!"
283,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,Another disappointing entry in the DC Comics cinematic universe.
284,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,To use a cliche - because this movie loves them - it's just crazy enough to work.
285,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is a hard concept to buy into, but when this much thought and care has gone into its construction, it's easy to get caught up in the wonderment of it all without asking too many questions."
286,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Aquaman promises to bring hope to the DC universe. [Full review in Spanish]
287,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Royalty is merely dignified status. Heroes are revered legends. Cue the ""why not both"" gif and you've got Aquaman."
288,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Love Momoa -- but two hours and twenty-three minutes is plenty of time to contemplate why Warners cannot manage ""the Marvel touch."""
289,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Momoa is a triumph in this joyously spectacular tale of myth and modernity; its hero so endearing it's easy to ignore the clunkiness of the dialogue and a villain treading water until next time. The salt water gets everywhere, I even found some in my eye."
290,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"It's good that Aquaman is so action packed and full of visual distractions that it doesn't leave you any time to reflect because once you stop to pause, the plot really sinks."
291,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"There is the occasional cool visual and clever world-building detail, like jellyfish couture and eye-popping underwater physics, but ""Aquaman"" never fully commits to its lunacy."
292,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"When it's not tediously predictable in its clichés, its complete lack of narrative or thematic daring, and its colorless meathead hero, it's a mess of incoherent action and noisy psychedelic chaos."
293,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"[Aquaman[ has seven seas' worth of the simpler kind of wonder, the razzle-dazzle imaginative kind."
294,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"At times, though, it's ludicrous even for kids' stuff, and its undersea make-believe means we face an even heavier battering from CGI than comic-book movies usually deliver."
295,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,It left me weary and water-logged. Blub-blub.
296,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,A spirited pulp-adventure that should make doubters take this fishy hero seriously.
297,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"""Aquaman"" is pure camp, wildly entertaining and an eye-popping spectacle. You have to admire the effort, scope and sheer audacity of everyone involved."
298,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"The character engagement is minimal and Wan doesn't make enough use of the charismatic Jason Momoa in the titular role, however there's a certain allure to the weird and wild places the film is willing to go on its bloated voyage."
299,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"As deeply entertaining as Aquaman proves to be, its full potential hasn't even begun to break the surface."
300,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Superhero stories aren't just about fighting, but the examination of self. When Aquaman remembers this, it's a sight to behold."
301,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"""Aquaman the film isn't as deep as the ocean, but Aquaman the man is just as captivating."""
302,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,An overstuffed B picture which stretches its fun too thin.
303,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Aquaman - for the DC Universe - is better than expected. But if you understand the cinematic inconsistencies within the franchise then you know that's not a complement.
304,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"The film isn't totally unenjoyable, but it isn't particularly coherent either."
305,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"At times spectacularly stupid, at other times just plain spectacular, Aquaman is Thor by way of the Fast and the Furious franchise."
306,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"The film is a treat to behold whenever it dives into the ocean as Wan embraces the absurdity at every turn, wearing the inherent goofiness as a badge of honour."
307,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It's neither the worst nor the best superhero film of the year, but it feels small compared to efforts like 'Infinity War' or 'Spider-verse'. [Full review in Spanish]"
308,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"When you start worrying in a superhero universe about the mechanics of how it works, it means that something isn't clicking."
309,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"I'm not saying Aquaman is good. But it is extremely watchable, totally insane good time."
310,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"But that did not justify a film that does not go either up or down, but floats desperately in a languid ocean so shallow that floating in it is clearly useless, unnecessary, a vile waste of energy. [Full Review in Spanish]"
311,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It's 2018, and I bought an Aquaman movie...it's Momoa or bust...the more I think about it, the more I like it."
312,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"There are a lot of things that work. The writing isn't the best, though and there are a lot of repetitive shots...just barely, it works."
313,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Sadly, it's a crazy amalgam of subpar storytelling, non-stop action and constantly swirling camera work. Motion sickness ahoy!"
314,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,Aquaman is simply too over-stuffed and over-long.
315,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"This is a competent enough origin story, but its oddball nature means that it's unintentionally hilarious at times."
316,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"People will be very cross that I don't ""get"" what was trying to be done, or that I didn't catch the comic references - but you know what? Get in the sea."
317,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"There is plenty here to admire and enjoy. Too much, really."
318,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"I didn't hate Aquaman, though at close to two-and-a-half hours it was beginning to outstay its welcome when the credits finally rolled."
319,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Director James Wan (Insidious, The Conjuring, Saw) has brought a very particular vision to the project and it's undoubtedly a brazenly idiosyncratic take on a superhero movie."
320,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is a colorful, action-packed spectacle with a somewhat feeble plot. Jason Momoa gives our hero a sardonic smile and punishing physical presence."
321,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,The film's real heroes are the SFX wizards and the production design team. They have really surpassed themselves creating fantastic underwater realms and making them teem with even more fantastical creatures.
322,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It's equal parts Game of Thrones and Indiana Jones; like Black Panther told from Killmonger's perspective. It isn't as polished as Wonder Woman, but neither is it as putrid as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."
323,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Not only it's surprisingly fun, but also visually ambitious. [Full review in Portuguese]"
324,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Whilst Aquaman is far from perfect, it still delivers an entertaining, vibrant ride and Momoa shows us what DC really stands for - Damn Cool."
325,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Go on, dive in."
326,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"There are no answers, because none are deemed necessary."
327,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"However, beyond the exuberant visual display to give life to the civilization of Atlantis and to develop the spectacular underwater battles, [James Wan's] contribution in Aquaman is disappointing. [Full Review in Spanish]"
328,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"With ups and downs between the fantastic and the absurd, Aquaman is plainly a fish out of water. [Full Review in Spanish]"
329,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"It has very little to call its own and in its quest to join the greatest hits, it ends up imitating some good hits without creating anything original. [Full Review in Spanish]"
330,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Director James Wan manages to make the film be unlike anything else in the genre. [Full Review in Spanish]
331,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"In short, Aquaman has tons of basic dialogues, a finite plot... and battles in hundreds of liters of water. [Full review in Spanish]"
332,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Underwater origin story has lots of comic book action.
333,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Like the story, the lines, the performances and the design, Aquaman is part camp, part kitsch, but all crap."
334,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Mercifully the scale is reduced to a more human size for the last action sequence which allows Momoa and Wilson to show off their posing and trident skills, which are considerable. The film is sure to be a rich source of desktop backgrounds."
335,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman, it's worth repeating, is gorgeous, the set-pieces across the various kingdoms of the underwater realm examples of artists allowed to not just hew close to the messed-up source but indulge in their own inspirations as well."
336,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Not perfect and a little long but fun, chaotic, an full of action, humor, adventure and a carisma-filled cast that enjoys itself as much as it wants the audience to enjoy it [Full review in Spanish]"
337,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,A fascinating and admirable journey that includes almost every element of the superhero genre you can think of. - [Full review in Spanish]
338,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Jason Momoa shines in a lighter-hearted role, and filmmaker James Wan fully embraces the plot's increasingly ridiculous gyrations."
339,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"The DC Comics aesthetic has never been more accurately portrayed on screen, so it has that going for it. Narratively, though, it's still kind of a mess. [Full Review in Spanish]"
340,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It avoids being sheepish about its more preposterous concepts, instead revelling in its comic book goofiness for a rollicking B movie adventure."
341,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Bold, ambitious, visually stunning, and wonderfully unique, James Wan's Aquaman is one of the best comic book films of the year."
342,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Aquaman is an adventure without an anchoring character or idea, and suffers from the plodding stolidness of its lead actors."
343,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It's still style over substance a lot of the time, but that style bears a real love for the source material, and that's what should be at the heart of every superhero film. Well, that and Jason Momoa's abs."
344,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"An epic adventure that takes audiences up in the air and down to the depths, offering myth, muscle, and pure big screen scale."
345,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It's just a fun, unchallenging adventure movie - perfect for the Christmas season."
346,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is a step toward restoring equilibrium, creating a sprawling undersea world that most closely resembles the Thor franchise in terms of scope, majesty and happily, humor."
347,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,Aquaman is such an eyeball-scald and an eardrum-shiv it makes me long for the relative excellence of Justice League.
348,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Wan manages to marry Arthurian fantasy and swashbuckling adventure with camp in Aquaman, a film that feels a little like a miracle in Warner Bros.' catalogue of superhero movies"
349,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Jason Momoa is an excellent Aquaman and the world of Atlantis looks like something out of ""Avatar."" But there are some things that feel too cartoonish, some jokes don't quite land, and the film continues to make some mistakes of past DC entries."
350,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,Director James Wan keeps things moving but seems a little out of his depth when fishing for laughs.
351,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Aquaman is a flawed but thoroughly entertaining adventure movie and certainly one of the strongest instalments so far in the inconsistent Worlds of DC franchise.
352,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,James Wan knows how to have fun with absurd material without making fun of it.
353,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It had a few stumbles, but as a whole, it is an awesome action-packed adventure."
354,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"What DC's Aquaman movie lacks in refinement, it makes up for with action spectacle and a whole lot of fun personality from Momoa's Arthur Curry."
355,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Not since ""Superman: The Movie"" have I seen a DC comic book movie wear its heart on its sleeve, unveiling every single element of the Aquaman lore with sheer unabashed excitement and enthusiasm."
356,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"[Aquaman] wasn't for me, but I admire a lot about this movie."
357,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"A superhero movie with the scope of an epic but the spirit of a mischievous boy, ""Aquaman"" is a goofy, uneven adventure that proudly sticks to its loopy vision even if it doesn't quite work."
358,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"I won't front like I didn't enjoy some elements of the film, but as a whole? It felt like I was watching a film based on what worked in a number of superhero flicks over the last few years."
359,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Jason Momoa's surf-bro superhero is a welcome addition to a ponderous genre, but his movie as a whole is waterlogged."
360,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It's 20,0000 leagues over the top!"
361,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"With fun, nonstop action, Wan's stylistic direction, and strong charismatic performances (especially by Momoa), ""Aquaman"" brilliantly solidifies that the DCEU is here to stay."
362,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"[A] nonstop rollercoaster ride of heart-pounding action, eye-popping visual spectacle, and all-around crowd-pleasing blockbuster entertainment that is insanely enjoyable to watch."
363,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Aquaman contains a one-on-one gladiator-style battle underwater and surrounded by lava. An octopus is also on the drums hyping up the fight. That's not even the craziest image in this aquatic adventure
364,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Bloated and overcooked, yes those two things are possible, the film somehow succeeds in its own zany weird way. Aquaman should be seen on the biggest screen possible with the least pretentiousness given."
365,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"The real appeal of Aquaman comes down to director James Wan, who goes full bore with all the Silver Age pulp the source material has to offer."
366,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"A fun, exciting, imaginative, occasionally silly but undoubtedly epic adventure that establishes an incredibly rich new cinematic world."
367,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Aquaman works as well as it does because director James Wan gives us a story in which we find ourselves wanting to tag along for the fun.
368,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Like with so many movies tasked with introducing unseen worlds and great reams of brand-new mythology, Wan's contribution to the DCEU offers a busy, overpowering deluge of information even if he conjures some stunning, operatic imagery along the way."
369,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"A star turn for Momoa, who leads the ridiculousness of this anarchic, campy superhero outing with serious energy and charm. Another promising move for the DCEU."
370,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It's certainly fun to watch, and I spent most of it giggling with glee and/or dismay at how crazy it all was. But it also feels like wasted potential."
371,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Rich and retro, Aquaman is a higher form of adventure hokum. It is made to silence people who grew up saying, ""They don't make films like that any more."""
372,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"James Wan has absolutely no sense of taste, but he has a grand sense of scale, which he leverages throughout the ludicrously insane, but fun, Aquaman to great effect."
373,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Swims into cinemas on a high tide of stunning CGI and waves of superhero comic book action.
374,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It feels like a step in the right direction for the DCEU. What's more, its hero's former 'joke character' status is kept well at bay."
375,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Take away Momoa's steady presence, and you're looking at an overstuffed mess that provides entertainment purely in an OMG-this-is-a-disaster kind of way."
376,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"This is a let-down: a laborious, slow-moving and dripping wet film, barnacle-encrusted with solemnity and with a ripply-underwater production design that looks like a giant version of the kitschy items that you put in fish-tanks."
377,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Notwithstanding the inevitable formulaic dialogue and a superabundance of boilerplate superhero action sequences, ""Aquaman"" turns out to be, almost despite itself, an engaging undersea extravaganza."
378,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Wan weaves comedy, sci-fi, high fantasy, and action into something that constantly surprises. Jam-packed with brilliant action, spectacular visuals, and likable characters, Aquaman is never afraid to have fun, which makes it a bright spark in 2018."
379,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman needs its smirking, beer-loving, roadie-looking, Chippendale-chested hero -- not to save the day, but to remind us that this is stuff is about as goofy as it gets."
380,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman's as formulaic, excessively thrashy, and mommy-obsessed as any other entry in the DCEU, but its visual imagination is genuinely exciting and transportive, and dare I say, fun."
381,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,James Wan has created something that feels fresh and new in a genre that is beginning to feel very tired and formulaic.
382,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"There's a knowing silliness to Aquaman that helps gloss over its sometimes-shaky CG and over-complicated mythology, and a willingness to go for broke that keeps us guessing about what we'll witness next."
383,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,I would watch Arthur Curry splash around throwing punches twenty times rather than return to a color-drained and depressing cityscape where the hero is sad and mad.
384,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Should I cheer? Should I laugh? Is everyone okay? Aquaman is one strange movie, but certainly a fun one."
385,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is a well blended smoothie of 1980s fare, which often works to its advantage but sometimes results in clumsy and clunky moments."
386,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,It's just H2-OK.
387,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Despite the nagging flaw that is Aquaman's hyper-extended plot, the movie delivers in its action sequences and its bright visuals."
388,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It might suffer from a patchwork script, a lack of sincere characterization, and tonal shifts that are more chaotic than any shark-on-whale battle, but damn if it doesn't look pretty."
389,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Its unapologetic ridiculousness is exactly why it's so delightful, bucking so many of the rules set for the genre in the last decade."
390,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Wan has taken a seemingly impossible task and imbued it with clarity and personality.
391,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Watching this movie is like spending two hours and 27 minutes staring at a gigantic aquarium full of digital sea creatures and actors on wires, pretending to swim."
392,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"Often divertingly colorful and busy to a fault, Aquaman seems to dare us to mock the world of comics' most risible superhero."
393,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"[James Wan's] conjured an intriguing world, but populated that world with dramatic cotton candy and silly characters, including a hero who's unsure if he wants to make us laugh or feel - and winds up doing neither."
394,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"In a better world, ""Aquaman"" would excel at delivering an ecological message to the masses. But all the fish in the sea can't salvage a movie that refuses to go more than surface deep."
395,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"The majority of the time the action set pieces seem quite arbitrary... This saddles the overlong film with a ponderous, grinding feel, one driven by a sense of obligation more than the glee of inspiration."
396,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"For all its sporadic wackiness and wonder, on balance Aquaman still comes out a bore. But they've given it a heroic shake."
397,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Welcome to Aquaman, where you won't have a clue what's going on, but you won't be able to look away either."
398,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"It is rousing fare, made with enough conviction for it to get away with its moments of extreme kitsch silliness."
399,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Even with its flaws and struggles with originality, Aquaman is reminiscent of the early Marvel movies in its storytelling, best when taking wild swings instead of being an earnest superhero jam."
400,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman swims more often than it sinks, buoyed by stunning visuals and an inherently compelling world that should be further developed beyond this origin film."
401,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"This is grandiose, big-budget entertainment at its most self-aware, and even when it swings and misses, it's still a sight to behold."
402,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"This really is the quintessential 21st century popcorn movie. Almost every shot has CGI surrounding the actors, it has a diverse cast, and there's enough action in it that you'll never feel bored."
403,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,The glee that director James Wan clearly has playing in the world of Aquaman is infectious. He's made a movie for both types of 10-year-olds: literal kids and those who are 10 at heart.
404,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Somehow manages to be the perfect blend of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and even a little Indiana Jones, yet still manages to be its very own thing."
405,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Sitting through Aquaman I had that feeling that I was watching a bad movie, but by the time the end credits rolled I had to accept the fact that I was consistently entertained and never bored by James Wan's crazy blockbuster."
406,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"""...a candy-colored underwater world that has humor and heart...If you can accept that people ride giant seahorses into battle, you are going to have a blast at this film."""
407,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"James Wan delivers an entertaining adventure film full of incredible visuals, exciting action and nifty camera work. Aquaman is a winner! [Full review in Spanish]"
408,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"It doesn't suck, but only if you're willing to sit through two hours of waterlogged world-building before the movie finally takes off."
409,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Wan seems to be operating under the philosophy that sci-fi/fantasy should stretch the limits of the imagination, even at the cost of possibly looking ludicrous. Either way, you're in for a spectacle."
410,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is imaginatively ambitious superhero cinema with no rules, which is more positive than negative as Wan's vision is realized like an underwater laser light spectacle that the DCEU so desperately needs right now."
411,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,Aquaman is a hit.
412,aquaman_2018,POSITIVE,"Aquaman is a new terrific entry in the belt of DC, a visual masterpiece that is utterly riveting throughout."
413,aquaman_2018,NEGATIVE,"It could have been worse, but maybe it could also have been good?"
0,morbius,NEGATIVE,It's a horrific mish-mash of other films that ends with two CGI monsters punching each other into walls while screaming about “ultimate power”.
1,morbius,NEGATIVE,The best part of “Morbius” were the opening and closing credits. It had a James Turrell color aesthetic with a dash of Nicholas Winding Refn’s “The Neon Demon” (2016).
2,morbius,NEGATIVE,"After multiple delays, Morbius, the “highly anticipated” new entry into Sony’s Spider-Man Universe, arrives with some of the worst world-building we have seen in a long time."
3,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius is a thin piece that lacks any reason to entice comic book fans, genre fans, or action fans."
4,morbius,NEGATIVE,"I can't even comprehend how they thought this was worth putting out. Worst of all, it connects itself to an actual good Spider-Man villain."
5,morbius,NEGATIVE,"A terribly dull movie that takes you back to the worst CBM’s in the 2000s. Jared Leto brings dedication, Matt Smith brings charm & is having the time of his life…. But god the script, the editing, the pacing was all terribly brought together"
6,morbius,NEGATIVE,"It’s not that Morbius is bad, but that it is so bad that it’s almost unwatchable. Matt Smith is a waste of great talent in a role that sees him go from practically paralyzed to supervillain in a matter of seconds."
7,morbius,NEGATIVE,"From the predictability and zero creativity of the main plot to the heavy reliance on uninteresting, unnecessary exposition, Daniel Espinosa finds his most significant problem in the blatant lack of care in the treatment of the characters."
8,morbius,NEGATIVE,It comes as no surprise that the extremely delayed Moribus is not the finest superhero movie ever released. The film lacks depth and intrigue. It’s a slow-moving exploration of a character that barely makes the case for its existence.
9,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Rumours circulating about Morbius made me apprehensive about attending the press screening, to begin with. But I went into it hoping for better. Unfortunately, the movie ended up being even worse than the rumours led me to believe."
10,morbius,NEGATIVE,"In the end, there’s a reason why Gen Z decided that the funniest thing they could say about it was that it was good, with their almost supernatural grasp of irony they can see that of all the things this movie is, good is not even remotely one of them."
11,morbius,NEGATIVE,Sony Pictures has proved one thing: Morbius succeeds as a vampire film as it drains life from itself.
12,morbius,POSITIVE,"Honestly, this is probably almost as good a Morbius film as you're going to get where it has a PG-13 rating and no Spider-Man involvement. Changing either of those things would have made it better."
13,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius is neither as dire as you have heard nor is it incredibly good. It’s mid-tier Marvel, not particularly inspired but not the worst thing I’ve ever sat through. If anything, it kind of reminds me of the Underworld series."
14,morbius,NEGATIVE,"It’s a throwback in form, but not in personality. There’s nothing weird or dated about this movie; it’s just filling a superhero quota."
15,morbius,NEGATIVE,"The movie is only bland and unpersuasive, and would have disappeared without a trace if not for the jolly internet memes that snarkily celebrated it, as though it were a lovably inept thing to be cherished, not chastised, for its flaws."
16,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Leto is certainly up for the role, and I can see where he could have done something special with a better script and more focused direction."
17,morbius,NEGATIVE,"The enjoyment of the film is certainly lessened by the film's darkness, and I don't mean its tonality."
18,morbius,NEGATIVE,Even if you take the poor quality and bland performance from Leto out of consideration - Morbius barely feels like a movie.
19,morbius,NEGATIVE,"There are no interesting characters, no clearly defined rules or powers, no exciting action setpieces, no eye-widening visual spectacle, and none of the sense of danger, addiction, or damnation you might assume would give something like this a spark."
20,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Falls apart at the halfway point due to its weak, and at times, laughable script and Jared Leto's lack of star power. It does, however, have a certain 'B' movie appeal."
21,morbius,NEGATIVE,This misfire only sinks its teeth into bland monotony; vampires aren't the only things that suck within its frames.
22,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius fails to grab the audience from the beginning and a plot that has quite a bit of potential, simply put, falls flat."
23,morbius,NEGATIVE,"... full of the kind of fantastical hijinks that make ""Venom"" (2018) and ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" (2021) popcorn delights, except where the nonsense in those films felt like part of the charm, here it’s an utter drag."
24,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Sadly just about every element of the film ends up dragging it down, including a screenplay in search of a more compelling plot, a multitude of bland characters, cheap-looking special effects, and a very subdued lead performance from Jared Leto."
25,morbius,NEGATIVE,"In the end, 'Morbius' feels like a rush to cash in on the strides the studio made with its more impressive features."
26,morbius,NEGATIVE,...feels like a generic template that someone forgot to fill in with interesting details before presenting it to the public.
27,morbius,NEGATIVE,I was feeling quite bored...They could have had a lot more fun with it.
28,morbius,NEGATIVE,It's very predictable…very melodramatic.
29,morbius,NEGATIVE,"A product that's empty, stunted, schizophrenic, induces the kind of tachycardia bad coffee can produce... [Full review in Spanish]"
30,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius suffers from a case of the doldrums, and with very few opportunities for the cast to liven up the material, the movie simply languishes towards an unappealing ending."
31,morbius,NEGATIVE,Why?
32,morbius,NEGATIVE,A multi-referential gazpacho... [Full review in Spanish]
33,morbius,NEGATIVE,To call Morbius a corporate corpse of a movie is too kind.
34,morbius,POSITIVE,"While it is a bit ridiculous and humble in its intentions, the film offers something to have fun with. [Full review in Spanish]"
35,morbius,POSITIVE,"A vampire movie, without too much blood or gore, but canonical. [Full review in Spanish]"
36,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Feels banal.
[Full review in Spanish]"
37,morbius,NEGATIVE,Pure formula… sustained with a special effects display that isn’t convincing or spectacular. [Full review in Spanish]
38,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Daniel Espinosa's film isn't awful by definition, but it's another reminder that when a comic book adaptation is produced poorly and without a real identity, the stink is much worse when you leave the theater."
39,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Vacant, lacking purpose, and no clear objective.
[Full review in Spanish]"
40,morbius,NEGATIVE,"A failed experiment from Marvel that resembles something akin to Count Dracula's second cousin. 
[Full review in Spanish]"
41,morbius,NEGATIVE,Lifeless...
42,morbius,POSITIVE,"Daniel Espinosa and his crew capably provide a rough and grungy Manhattan for Michael Morbius to hunt in. Morbius is a remarkable monster movie, powered by the brotherly love experienced by Michael and Lucian/Milo."
43,morbius,POSITIVE,"With THE LITTLE THINGS and his sensational, transformation in HOUSE OF GUCCI, Leto is totally invested and gives the Marvel Universe a mesmerizing character shaped with conflicting appetites."
44,morbius,NEGATIVE,"...a hit-and-miss adaptation that is, to an increasingly distressing extent, more miss than hit..."
45,morbius,POSITIVE,"While the initial cat-and-mouse chase is exciting, particularly as the super-humans face-off against each other, it does lose its momentum relatively quickly."
46,morbius,NEGATIVE,"It feels like there was a really decent draft of this movie waiting to be discovered, and, whilst it succeeds at times, instead, Morbius feels hollow and very much like a missed opportunity."
47,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Despite Jared Leto being in this misbegotten affair, I have to say it did not rise to my expectations for it."
48,morbius,NEGATIVE,It doesn't do anything we haven't seen before. The visual effects are rather tired.
49,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Odd that playing a man transforming into a vampire feels like a more lived-in, relaxed performance for Leto than his cartoonish Italian fop in ""House of Gucci,"" but at least he seems to be having fun with it."
50,morbius,NEGATIVE,"If you want the scientific structure and creativity of Birdemic, this one's for you."
51,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Playing the Living Vampire, Leto gets the benefit of introducing a Spider-man villain thats never been seen in live-action before. Unfortunately, his performance and most of Morbius as a whole are layered in melodrama and CGI fakery."
52,morbius,NEGATIVE,"A lot of this movie made zero sense. Trying to take elements from ""No Way Home"" and insert them in here was very misguided. This is an incredibly bad comic book film that revolves around one of the least interesting Spiderman villains."
53,morbius,NEGATIVE,"This was remarkably bad and somehow bored me to tears despite the insanity on-screen. The plot had more holes than swiss cheese. The character development was nonexistent. Please keep the MCU far, far away from what Sony is doing..."
54,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Somehow, Jared Leto is not even the best Jared in Morbius. Oh, I just, enough with the origin stories we did not ask for."
55,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Simply put, Morbius is one of the laziest, shallowest, most pathetic attempts at a movie blockbuster in some time."
56,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Not the epic disaster we expected...It is, however, generic as all hell."
57,morbius,NEGATIVE,"A case of (the filmmakers) had a character, but didnt quite know what to do with it. I think its quite a messy plot that doesnt always make that much sense A bit different with the horror theme, but nothing special."
58,morbius,NEGATIVE,The effects-laden film with its hollow storyline ends up being filler between web-slinger releases and it makes sure you know that thanks to all the SSU references.
59,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Superficial character development, and shady morals, means it is hard to work up much sympathy for most of the characters in this movie, including Morbius himself. Who are we intended to identify with? Who are we intended to respect or admire?"
60,morbius,NEGATIVE,This is what we've been waiting for since 2020? Yall are proud of this? Must be some type of happy accident for Sony to finally release this on April 1st because this movie's existence is a joke.
61,morbius,NEGATIVE,'Morbius' gives audiences little to sink their teeth into.
62,morbius,NEGATIVE,An attempt to toss in some comedy fails miserably. The evil doings and essential fight come across as labored and expected for the genre.
63,morbius,NEGATIVE,Will ‘Morbius’ go down as one of the worst Marvel-adjacent movies ever? That’s easy: Yes. But most of our Morbius questions are harder to answer.
64,morbius,NEGATIVE,"If it were just a ride in a theme park, Morbius would be fun enough. But it is not."
65,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Maybe the sequel will be better because all the introductory stuff is stuffed into this sluggish overstuffed adventure movie. Besides I thought ""Batman"" owned the rights to the use of bats."
66,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius, at best, will be remembered as the latest effort on Sony's part to make its nascent Sinister Six franchise happen. And, like ""fetch,"" it's hard to see that happening."
67,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Coming off the heels of superhero masterpieces such as Spider-Man: No Way Home and The Batman, Morbius is a movie you might stumble across on cable TV and play in the background as you do your household chores rather than appointment viewing."
68,morbius,NEGATIVE,"This is nothing less than an absolute fiasco, a dingy, instantly forgettable entry in the bargain-bin branch of the MCU that should be shoved back into its crypt and buried under an avalanche of bat guano."
69,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius becomes pat and predictable, with so-so FX that look like something from an “Underworld” flick from two decades ago."
70,morbius,POSITIVE,"Is it a movie you should see? Honestly, yes."
71,morbius,NEGATIVE,"These kinds of movies are supposed to be morality tales in which the protagonist comes to a tragic end. But a tragic end cant become a franchise, so Morbius flinches from its necessary conclusion, leaving an already confused movie without a payoff."
72,morbius,POSITIVE,"Doesn't deliver a lot of high notes, but it's not unwatchable (especially if you enjoy the vampire genre). ""Morbius"" is not as great as you'd hoped, but not as bad as you feared."
73,morbius,NEGATIVE,There’s such little meat on the bone here plot-wise that it feels like everyone involved in the production got a checklist of beats that the studio wanted to hit and did their best to make that all that they did.
74,morbius,POSITIVE,"Overall, this is an entertaining movie. It sucks you in with the action and standout scenes between some of the characters. But, while Morbius has the makings of a great anti-hero revival, it wavers with the execution."
75,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Sadly, director Daniel Espinosa's action horror is itself drained of atmosphere, shocks and drama."
76,morbius,POSITIVE,Like the Venom films  and unlike the MCU movies  Morbius eschews the mythmaking of the Avengers for darkly comic horror.
77,morbius,NEGATIVE,Morbius is an incoherent and unoriginal film that doesn’t make the best use of Jared Leto’s talents.
78,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Jared Leto has been exquisitely vulnerable (Requiem for a Dream), exquisitely sinister (Blade Runner 2049) and exquisitely ridiculous (House of Gucci). Yet in Morbius, he’s something he’s never been before: disastrously dull."
79,morbius,NEGATIVE,"A mishmash of shoddy-looking effects work and oddball creative choices, a mélange of nonsense that could have been somewhat forgiven if the movie was any fun ... but it isn't. In short, Morbius kind of sucks."
80,morbius,NEGATIVE,"So many choices... just seem halfhearted. They're not terrible, but they're also not interesting."
81,morbius,POSITIVE,"I'd gone into Morbius expecting a throwaway comicbook movie, but the director Daniel Espinosa and writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless seem to have higher aspirations."
82,morbius,NEGATIVE,"It is dull and generic which is a real shame because the cast is talented and the premise has potential to be weird and exciting. In the end, its just forgettable."
83,morbius,POSITIVE,"The further I get from it, the more its flaws seem crippling, but I admire the spirit that Espinosa and company brought to the project, which, Im convinced, was nearly destroyed by a meddlesome and cowardly studio."
84,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius sometimes works great, but these memorable moments are spaced too sporadically throughout the film. It's worth watching to see the delightful performance from Matt Smith, who perfectly balances the campiest moments with the most emotional."
85,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Its hard to say if Morbius was doomed from the start, but after years of anticipating its tepid arrival, the final film earns a yawn as large as its protagonists unhinged snarl."
86,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Its unfair, but mostly accurate, to call Morbius a speed bump in the trajectory of comic book films."
87,morbius,NEGATIVE,Ghoulish Gothic gloom....
88,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Here's Jared Leto, ditched from the DC Extended Universe for his hammy take on The Joker, starring in his first solo movie for Marvel. It's the dullest film to ever carry that flickering logo."
89,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Just plain miserable to sit through, offering almost nothing pleasurable either ironically or unironically."
90,morbius,NEGATIVE,"... we know where its been, where its going, and theres zero emotional impact when we get there without a hint of a denouement... a total DC-MurderVerse move to computer-animate the entire final battle climax..."
91,morbius,NEGATIVE,"An often bored-looking Leto isnt helped by a formulaic, generic, cliché-ridden screenplay credited to Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. Anonymous, borderline competent direction comes thanks to Swedish-born Daniel Espinosas (Life, Safe House) ..."
92,morbius,NEGATIVE,Ultimately I’ll say that the movie wasn’t the trainwreck I was expecting... But I’d rather see a flaming disaster from a team of passionate creatives than a sanitized jigsaw puzzle assembled by a board of directors any day.
93,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Like most April Fools' Day jokes, Morbius is not actually funny. It’s not bad in the ha ha you have to see this it’s so ridiculous kind of way. It just feels underbaked and lame -- and, sadly, not weird enough to be any kind of fun."
94,morbius,NEGATIVE,"As comic book movies go it's overwhelmingly underwhelming, a lifeless carcass of a film that serves its immediate purpose but inspires zero desire to have this character's story continue in future films."
95,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Alas, the total quantity of wit in this movie is to a soupçon what Jared Leto is to Daniel Day-Lewis."
96,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius ultimately feels less than the sum of its parts. While there might have been a good movie somewhere pre-reshoots, the film never finds its footing. That said, it's not nearly as bad as others pre-decided it would be."
97,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius is dreadful, quite possibly the worst example of the comic-book, super-hero genre I’ve ever seen."
98,morbius,NEGATIVE,"[An] incoherent, vampire-themed Marvel offcut."
99,morbius,NEGATIVE,Leto is smoothly charismatic but is given nothing of interest to do.
100,morbius,NEGATIVE,A blood-sucking example of why not everything ever published by Marvel Comics deserves a movie.
101,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Despite only being a little over 90 minutes long, Morbius is a chore to sit through. It lacks imagination, zest, and a thrill of discovery."
102,morbius,POSITIVE,Morbius is a surprisingly solid building block for Sony as it looks to expand its universe of heroes and villains.
103,morbius,NEGATIVE,Morbius internal conflict is brushed aside and the movies central theme is abandoned and forgotten in a chaotic mass of special effects and a mad rush to set up more sequels.
104,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Take the legacy character out of the equation, and this is virtually indistinguishable from any garden-variety horrorthriller released in the post-Oscars dumping ground."
105,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Finally, a full year after its initial release date, it is finally seeing the light of day. And let me be the one to say: I could have happily waited another decade."
106,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Between the lack of atmosphere, underdeveloped characters and questionable visuals, Morbius just doesnt know how to hold its audiences attention."
107,morbius,POSITIVE,"Jared Leto trades in his clown shoes for fangs  and, of course, its as silly and bad as you thought. However, its never not entertaining, and Matt Smith understood the assignment."
108,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Occasionally, it's not as ghastly as it might sound, mostly thanks to Leto's general gravitas and a supervillain (Matt Smith from ""The Crown"") thoroughly enjoying his own personal discoveries."
109,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Its a bit like a hastily and inexpertly assembled jigsaw puzzle. While the overall picture is obvious, the individual pieces dont fit into place, and after awhile, you stop caring."
110,morbius,NEGATIVE,"The misfiring ""Morbius"" at a certain point just stops firing, but not before it stops making sense."
111,morbius,NEGATIVE,"...despite aspirations to Cronenbergian body-horror, Morbius' bloody action amounts to a lengthy thin-off between Leto and Smith..."
112,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Although Dracula has long represented the outsider, Morbius spends the whole film trying to be more normal."
113,morbius,POSITIVE,"More horror than hero, Morbius is as dark and brooding as The Batman, but with less style and substance. Yet, the themes and origin story are intriguing, and a different product than routine Marvel comic books-turned-movies."
114,morbius,NEGATIVE,"A painfully boring, listless, tedious (slightly ableist) horror action film that never quite knows where it wants to go..."
115,morbius,NEGATIVE,"In short, going for the vampiric pun youd expect, this sucks."
116,morbius,NEGATIVE,"An interesting choice: Every fight sequence or use of superpowers in Morbius is done under a fart cloud. Some may say its vampire mist or puff of smoke, but I know a plume of flatulence when I see it."
117,morbius,POSITIVE,"A mediocre mixed bag of a 90s B movie that, despite its many flaws, represents an acceptable introduction to Jared Leto's anti-hero."
118,morbius,NEGATIVE,"At this point, I think it's fair to say that any comic book character that has even the most remote stink of Spider-Man on them is fair game for a film adaptation (I'm looking at you, Venom movies), whether they deserve one or not."
119,morbius,POSITIVE,"Geez everybody, calm down. There is an essential question about the bodily handicaps in the story, which gives it some heft ... what is one willing to give away to get cured of a disease thats essentially a living death? Disgust for drinking blood? Cool."
120,morbius,NEGATIVE,"I cant remember a Marvel movie that went to less trouble giving us an origin story, that put more effort into tying the tale into this corner of the Marvel universe, and that had less going for it."
121,morbius,NEGATIVE,Morbius comes across as a dull exercise in how not to maintain property rights or entertain an audience.
122,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Humorless and as flat and as uninspired as the Venom movies were, this by-the-numbers comic book action movie seems to be operating entirely on auto-pilot, ticking off plot boxes as it goes."
123,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius’s greater fault is that it cleaves away the vampire mythology without replacing that mythology with anything fun, new, or particularly interesting."
124,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius is a forgettable, often laughable, entry in Sony’s attempt to fill its own Spider-Man-adjacent cinematic universe, a poorly edited, derivative time suck -- pun intended."
125,morbius,NEGATIVE,"The film’s plot is lackluster, and there’s no humor, no charm, and no warmth to be found. It’s rare to see a film so devoid of style and ambition, that slugs along like a direct-to-video Underworld sequel."
126,morbius,NEGATIVE,Morbius joins the glaring disappointments of Suicide Squad and the yakuza drama The Outsider as the latest instalment in a hit-and-miss career.
127,morbius,NEGATIVE,"It would seem fairly difficult to make a boring vampire flick, let alone one tied to the Marvel universe, but here we have it. Yes, vampires suck, but so does this movie."
128,morbius,POSITIVE,"Hardly the best in the superhero game, but a decently entertaining and moody entry that's hands down better than the lackluster ""Venom"" series."
129,morbius,NEGATIVE,Sucks the fun out of everything.
130,morbius,POSITIVE,"Morbius has no reason to exist as an actual movie, but maybe that’s why it worked for me."
131,morbius,NEGATIVE,"An all-around ill-conceived effort sporting a boring hero, an uninteresting villain, and probably the least-appealing visual style of any film this year."
132,morbius,NEGATIVE,A nonsensical FrankensteinDraculaJekyll & Hyde mashup from Marvel.
133,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Alas, ""Morbius"" is too bound to comic book movie convention to become the overt gay vampire superhero melodrama it probably should have been."
134,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius had every opportunity to be just as groundbreaking as that other Marvel vampire film was years ago, but instead it feels like just another nail in the coffin of Sonys Spider-verse."
135,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Leto tries to turn the biochemist-turned-vampire into a a character of Shakespearean proportion, but is tripped up by the weak, derivative screenplay."
136,morbius,POSITIVE,"Morbius is a throwback to a simpler and less sophisticated era of superhero movies. Its not terrible, great, or even so bad, its goodits just super average."
137,morbius,NEGATIVE,Morbius tries to drain the life out of you by boring you to death. It doesn't even do us the courtesy of being so bad it's good.
138,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Takes the earnest approach to its tale of a brilliant scientist making a grave error of judgment, and then presents it as a slog fraught with clichéd tropes."
139,morbius,NEGATIVE,It is so consistently uninventive  even apathetic  that one cannot help but ask if anyone involved even considered the possibility that making a good movie was an option.
140,morbius,POSITIVE,It’s been far too long since I’ve seen a superhero movie whose special effects were both jaw-dropping and seemingly effortless.
141,morbius,NEGATIVE,"...when Jared Leto is the best part of your movie, you know you are in serious trouble."
142,morbius,NEGATIVE,The film wants the true conflict to be between Morbius and his vampire self. Will Morbius give in to his dark side?...Let me say this again: I. Do. Not. CARE.
143,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Jared Leto goes the extra mile to bring a minor-league villain from Marvel Comics to the big screen, but this botched horrorfest about the so-called living vampire is less deserving of a sequel than a stake through its heart."
144,morbius,NEGATIVE,Too many films like Morbius could hasten the death of superhero cinema.
145,morbius,NEGATIVE,"The cast cannot elevate a bland, lifeless narrative with direction from Daniel Espinosa that fails to capture any of the romantic yearning and melancholy associated with vampires or the excitement of the superhero genre the world has grown to love."
146,morbius,NEGATIVE,"As disappointing as the movie may be, its post-credit sequence is even worse."
147,morbius,NEGATIVE,Are we sure this isnt some kind of elaborate April Fools Day prank?
148,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Even at 104 minutes, practically a short by superhero-movie standards, “Morbius” feels draggy."
149,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Despite solid performances and flashes of promise, Morbius is a flat, forgettable affair, failing to deliver an anti-hero origin story we can really sink our teeth into."
150,morbius,NEGATIVE,"It has a truncated, cut-down feel to it, a suspicion supported by the presence of scenes in the trailer that didn't show up in the finished film."
151,morbius,NEGATIVE,"""Morbius wasnt good: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that."""
152,morbius,NEGATIVE,Morbius's greatest legacy might be that it united the internet to dunk on a movie nobody asked for.
153,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Merely adequate, and by Marvel standards, slightly anemic."
154,morbius,NEGATIVE,"The action sequences are forgettable, a blur of CGI punches and jumping sequences in which Morbius leaves a trail of streamy ribbons in his wake that are supposed to show his flight but instead look like the remnants of a retired cheerleaders pom-pom."
155,morbius,NEGATIVE,It's impressive to live in a day and age where comic movies can still be this bad.
156,morbius,NEGATIVE,Morbius isn't a bad movie. It also isn't a particularly memorable one.
157,morbius,NEGATIVE,"When you combine bad dialogue, questionable editing, and a dead-serious tone - the result is not exactly great."
158,morbius,NEGATIVE,"I may not have been a big fan of the Venom films, but it is easy to see their appeal. Hardy is putting his all into an off-the-wall dual performance...With that in mind, I would be hard-pressed to understand what Morbius has to offer."
159,morbius,POSITIVE,"It is almost a shame that Morbius is tied to the Marvel universe at all, given that the inclusion brings with it franchise expectations that don't serve the characters key traits at all."
160,morbius,NEGATIVE,"The script and direction is so bland that even Jared Leto couldn't inject any charm, menace or a skerrick of personality into the character."
161,morbius,NEGATIVE,Boring! And thats a death knell for anything coming out of Marvel Comic Universe.
162,morbius,POSITIVE,"Other than being predictable with repetitive visual effects, I found MORBIUS intriguing."
163,morbius,NEGATIVE,Morbius delivers a toothless and aggressively soulless descent into beige superhero formula.
164,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Its watchable, but the by-the-numbers execution leaves Morbius just a bit anemic."
165,morbius,NEGATIVE,"""Morbius"" caps off bad month for bat men, but at least it's weird enough to be occasionally enjoyable."
166,morbius,NEGATIVE,Morbius is like a can of flat soda.
167,morbius,NEGATIVE,"There's a decided B-movie feel hanging over the whole thing, no matter how much gratuitous CGI it throws at us. Simply put, this is not the preferred comics-based bat man to see on screens right now."
168,morbius,NEGATIVE,A living vampire and a lifeless movie.
169,morbius,POSITIVE,"Morbius is a character whos caught between two worlds (man and monster), and his movie is stuck in a similar liminal space that ultimately makes it unremarkable."
170,morbius,NEGATIVE,[A] lazy actioner so forced and derivative that it feels like it came out in 2002 rather than 2022.
171,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Even by the standards of the many monotonous origin stories that have been rolled out during this superhero boom, Daniel Espinosa’s film is a whiff."
172,morbius,NEGATIVE,"If Instagram had a “blockbuster” filter, this film would use it the whole time."
173,morbius,POSITIVE,"Not the best written, but Jared Leto's surprisingly restrained performance mixed with Matt Smith's scenery chewing makes this a decent enough monster movie."
174,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius is disjointed, rushed, poorly edited, and then it ends abruptly with viewers just kind of staring at their screen wondering what just happened."
175,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Over the years, there have been plenty of mediocre movies associated with the Marvel brand, but I can’t recall one so blatantly willing to leave viewers shortchanged."
176,morbius,NEGATIVE,This movie is also devoid of depth. It is emblematic of a system that places amusement park wonderment above sturdy storytelling.
177,morbius,NEGATIVE,"It starts well, builds to some promise, but ends incredibly clumsily, wasting the likes of Jared Harris (super underrated), Adria Arjona (who has excelled on shows like Good Omens), and yes, believe it or not, even Tyrese. Full review in Spanish."
178,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Not good. It includes a weak story, stale performances, and jerky action and editing. Serves as a reminder of what a disappointing superherocomic film looks like. Full review in Spanish"
179,morbius,NEGATIVE,"It's as disorienting as a Moebius strip--the effects erase the characters and nearly the entire picture, the script does not care to explain characters or plots, and all we are left with is yet another Spider-Man villain who in reality is a nice guy"
180,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Jared Leto stars as a sulking, skulking vampire in a bloodless and boring comics adaptation desperately riding the coat-tails of the Marvel movie powerhouse."
181,morbius,NEGATIVE,"It's ultimately easier to think of Morbius as a campy, marginally entertaining one-off rather than the franchise-starter it so obviously tries to be."
182,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius hits the ground running, but the Living Vampire movie is ultimately an uneven film that never quite figures out what it wants to be."
183,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Unless your ticket is free, don’t bother. This movie is as lifeless as the bodies Morbius drains and throws on the floor."
184,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Apparently, the early 2000 days of insultingly lazy superhero movies have not yet died out"
185,morbius,POSITIVE,"Morbius is a good-enough introduction for a character who most viewers may not know well. Its not spectacular entertainment like the Spider-Man movies, but neither will it have viewers wishing for their money back."
186,morbius,POSITIVE,"While most of it is as predictably familiar as expected, it does something unusual for a movie like this: It entertains you, rather than bludgeons you into submission."
187,morbius,NEGATIVE,"The film is just another vampire movie rather than an origins Marvel story. With a predictable plot, inconsistent beats, flat dialogue and bland characters, Morbius is a huge letdown. The post credits feel like a sloppy afterthought."
188,morbius,NEGATIVE,"I know that the fans will spend their time and money to see the latest Spidey-verse version entry and more power to them. But, for everyone else without that fandom fervor, why bother?"
189,morbius,POSITIVE,"Significantly better than Venom but still somewhat lacking in bite, this origin story perhaps inevitably grows more pallid toward the end but until then proves just tasty enough to merit the giving it a shot."
190,morbius,NEGATIVE,"There's nothing in ""Morbius"" that couldn't have been better summed up in a two-minute trailer."
191,morbius,POSITIVE,"I'm not gonna lie, it's difficult to watch the Joker and the Eleventh Doctor battle it out on-screen with teeth and claws, but Morbius manages to make it work.  It's not a movie everyone will love, but don't dismiss it just yet"
192,morbius,NEGATIVE,You can only imagine the carnage that must have taken place in the edit suite.
193,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Soulless, tedious filmmaking. The doldrums of superhero theatrics."
194,morbius,NEGATIVE,"What could've been an attempt at outright horror succumbs to the usual super-hero sturm und drang, just superpowered characters filling a third act fighting and destroying buildings. In the SonyMarvel universe, even vampires must go big or go home."
195,morbius,NEGATIVE,"It doesnt even have the so-bad-its-good qualities that made Venom morbidly enjoyable, quickly placing it amongst the worst recent examples of the genre alongside X-Men: Dark Phoenix and 2015s Fantastic Four."
196,morbius,NEGATIVE,"More like Bore-bius, amirite? The action scenes are poorly staged and the special effects are awful. Plus, it spends much too much time on the origin story somehow without ever making us connect to the title character."
197,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius is a perfunctory, sloppy, paint-by-numbers attempt to remind audiences that Sony has the rights to these Spider-Man villains and by golly theyre going to use them."
198,morbius,NEGATIVE,"While the latest Marvel origin story features plenty of bats, it doesnt hold a candle to The Batman."
199,morbius,NEGATIVE,A dark adventure that gets darker as it goes.
200,morbius,NEGATIVE,"This might sound silly, but Morbius the Vampire feels like he deserves better."
201,morbius,NEGATIVE,There’s little spark in Leto’s performance.
202,morbius,NEGATIVE,"No harm to Leto, who wears less makeup as a vampire here than he did as a human in House of Gucci, but he appears to be taking the silly role absurdly seriously."
203,morbius,NEGATIVE,"He's simply not particularly interesting, and neither is his origin story."
204,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius is a fellow tortured by a self-inflicted curse, but his anguish is nothing compared to the pain this terrible movie inflicts on the audience."
205,morbius,NEGATIVE,"'Morbius' is a huge step backwards for Sony's Spider-Man Universe, and the worst Marvel-branded movie to come along in a long time."
206,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius is what happens when a studio applies a horror filter to an average comic book picture. The filter may shade the original image differently, but its an unconvincing effect."
207,morbius,NEGATIVE,"At one point Morbius warns, ""I'm getting hungry. You wouldn't like me when I'm hungry."" My good doctor, we don't like you now! And nothing that occurs before the credits roll changes that."
208,morbius,NEGATIVE,"It's one of those films like 'Jonah Hex' or 'The Phantom,' something pop culture will occasionally reference in ten or 20 years and we'll all think 'Oh, that's right. They made a movie out of that!'"
209,morbius,NEGATIVE,"The studio may have accidentally created the first Shepard film: it goes on for about an hour and 45 minutes, and right up until the second it ends, you keep feeling as if it’s just about to start."
210,morbius,NEGATIVE,A cash-grab so sloppy it makes you wonder if the top brass at Sony are nihilistic members of the undead.
211,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius may be a living vampire, but this supervillain origin story is dead on arrival. A rote, lifeless and cynical attempt to expand Sony’s Spidey-Verse."
212,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Lacking in style, spirit, scares, and suspense, this would-be thriller is a toothless and tedious chore."
213,morbius,NEGATIVE,"'Morbius' really does... sigh suck. Yes, we couldn't even come up with something more inventive, folks."
214,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Dull, messy and badly executed, Morbius falls spectacularly short in terms of excitement or entertainment."
215,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Likely undone by a PG-13 rating that must have shaved off some of, what could have been, effective horror elements, its a defanged vampire movie with no bite."
216,morbius,POSITIVE,"Watch out for the thrilling moments, gravity-defying stunts and special effects that compensate for what’s missing in making it the action-adventure extravaganza it was expected to be."
217,morbius,NEGATIVE,"In downplaying Donna’s own extensive work as an activist and the history she is a part of, Bedwani offers up a lacking portrait of her."
218,morbius,NEGATIVE,"It is a muddy puddle of a blockbuster; aimless, dull and lacking in a pulse."
219,morbius,NEGATIVE,This is just a total embarrassment to the legacy of Marvel Comics and goes to prove after Spider-Man: No Way Home that Sony really can’t make a good comic book movie without Disney anymore.
220,morbius,NEGATIVE,"My bafflement regarding Leto is becoming chronic, and I’m still recovering from his opera buffa turn and Chico Marx dialect in “House of Gucci.”"
221,morbius,NEGATIVE,"This is a movie that feels like one big windup for something else, even if we walk out feeling we’ve already seen plenty."
222,morbius,NEGATIVE,"For a darker, vampiric twist on the superhero origin, Morbius is all bark & no bite  resulting in a formulaic origins tale which descends into a CGI mess."
223,morbius,POSITIVE,"A stylish, special effects-clad vampire flick that'll keep you perfectly entertained on a red eye flight"
224,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Even the action scenes are rendered as pig-ugly blotches of dull pixels, with the climactic scuffle so colourless as to be entirely incomprehensible."
225,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Even though there are flashes of promise, Morbius ends up being a bland and confused origin tale of the type we thought we had left behind."
226,morbius,POSITIVE,"A fairly good, if gloom-laden jaunt, happily uncluttered by the tangle of poorly told sub-plots that afflict most superhero films...Jared Leto lending just enough serious-actor gravitas to his lines about feeling alive for the first time in his life."
227,morbius,NEGATIVE,"To call Morbius compelling would be overstating it. But there's enough energy and competent filmmaking here, plus an anchoring performance from Jared Leto, to probably qualify it as worthwhile for many who would be predisposed to care about its existence."
228,morbius,NEGATIVE,Morbius has serviceable action but zero surprises.  The film's talented lead actors go through the motions of a rote and predictable anti-hero blockbuster.
229,morbius,NEGATIVE,"A throwback to the mid-2000s comic book film in all the worst ways. For audiences too young to remember what a lot of comic movies were like before the MCU - here it is, kids! This is what we had to grow up with!"
230,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius sends Marvel back to the bad old pre-Marvel Cinematic Universe days. The characters are poorly drawn, motivations are muddled and special effects are slathered over the film to cover up the patchier elements."
231,morbius,NEGATIVE,"The complexity of the character appears to be there for the writers, but Sazama and Sharpless peel away many potentially interesting problems."
232,morbius,POSITIVE,"A monster movie with a little bite, ""Morbius"" is elevated by some spirited performances and director Daniel Espinosa's sure hand with familiar comic-book material."
233,morbius,NEGATIVE,"It's a snack in a world of 150+ minute superhero banquets; by the time you notice the meal is lacking a certain something, youre already out the door"
234,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Featuring scattered storytelling and an unfocused script, Morbius is a huge missed opportunity. Leto is compelling, and his relationship with Smiths Milo had potential, but the movie struggles to bring it all together."
235,morbius,NEGATIVE,"A flat, dull mess of a blockbuster that commits the cardinal cinematic sin of being unfathomably boring."
236,morbius,NEGATIVE,The latest anti-hero saga deserves better than this meandering origin story.
237,morbius,NEGATIVE,Daniel Espinosas direction is largely pedestrian. Hes more like a work for hire rather than a visionary filmmaker with a distinct visual style.
238,morbius,NEGATIVE,"The best thing about Morbius is it keeps the utterly obvious plot moving along, and isnt exactly boring. But thats hardly a ringing endorsement."
239,morbius,POSITIVE,"Whatever, man - I liked it! A very good vampire movie starring Jared Leto and Matt Smith, both in top form. Similar to 2009's Daybreakers. As good a launch as 2018's Venom. Fun theater experience if you're into comic book movies."
240,morbius,POSITIVE,"Its actually a pretty decent premise for a superhero movie, and in its early moments Morbius is quite promising."
241,morbius,POSITIVE,"Running at 104 minutes, I was pretty impressed by its core theme: health is a privilege."
242,morbius,NEGATIVE,Morbius works better as a horror movie than as a vampire superhero origin story that's supposed to have a place in the Spider-Man franchise. Morbius has too many plot holes and not enough personality for it to ever be considered a classic superhero film.
243,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Spoiler alert: it's leading to nothing but confusion, as not even Sony knows what they're doing with it. The best possibility here is for none of us to ever find out what would happen next, because, frankly, who cares?"
244,morbius,NEGATIVE,"If there is any justice in Hollywood, Morbius will be retconned to the margins of superhero cinema history. If the film doesn’t bury the genre alive first, that is."
245,morbius,NEGATIVE,"The cinematic equivalent of Murphy’s Law is demonstrated by this appalling superhero snooze-fest. It’s a movie without dramatic jeopardy, originality, narrative coherence, compelling characters or a single even vaguely human performance."
246,morbius,POSITIVE,"Morbius does eventually become a cluttered slugfest, as all things must. But for much of its run it is a stylish, intriguingly toned story of a man trying to thwart mortality."
247,morbius,NEGATIVE,A misbegotten superhero/horror hybrid.
248,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Suffering from the same problems of trying to be dark and violent but still all-ages that Venom did, Morbius lacks the staying power and charm of its predecessor due in large part to its lead."
249,morbius,NEGATIVE,"A bland, competent, and safe superhero adventure that seems destined to be forgotten before its end credits finish rolling."
250,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Without, say, someone like Tom Hardy embracing the weirdness of the character in Venom, it’s tough to find rooting interest or muster any excitement for the vampiric bat man."
251,morbius,NEGATIVE,"If superhero movies really are going to dominate modern cinema for the next decade or so, we should at least be allowed a little healthy competition between studios. I hope, in the future, Sony can put up a better fight than this."
252,morbius,POSITIVE,Morbius is surprisingly an okay film with Jared Leto delivering a somber performance as the vampiric antihero.
253,morbius,NEGATIVE,"When you watch Morbius, there's an inescapable sense that someone had to be actively trying to make a movie this bad."
254,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Mostly, the film occupies a strange no-mans-land of the sprawling Spider-Verse, not charming like the Spider-Man films, not funny like the Venom films, and certainly not technically impressive like the animated “Into the Spider-Verse.”"
255,morbius,NEGATIVE,"The entire movie, directed by Daniel Espinosa from a script by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, is generic -- naggingly, almost jarringly so. You watch it and think, “This is what now passes for a new Marvel chapter?”"
256,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Is Morbius the worst Marvel movie ever made? In an alternate universe without The New Mutants, the answer would likely be yes."
257,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Missing much of its connective tissue to make sense of its shenanigans, this titular anti-hero is given a vehicle that takes its foot off the gas not far enough into the ride."
258,morbius,NEGATIVE,"This movie isn’t terrible. Leto is good, the VFX work is slick, and there’s modest entertainment to be had here and there. But it seems unlikely to please crowds like Spider-Man: No Way Home."
259,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius is bad, yes, but its not even fun-bad, like the Venom movies; its just kind of depressing."
260,morbius,NEGATIVE,Morbius is unspectacular in ways that waste the potential of what could be an intriguing hybrid of sinister horror and superhero thrills.
261,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius is a movie Sony has been trying to make since the early 2000s, and the film being released in 2022 feels like a relic from that early 2000s era of superhero movies, and not in a good way."
262,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius, despite the best efforts of its cast, suffers from a number of problems. It’s not a Marvel film showing its A-game. At its absolute best, it’s pedestrian and lacks scope. At its worst, it is unintentionally silly."
263,morbius,NEGATIVE,A second-tier MCU movie with some interesting performances and a few flashes of inspiration that unfortunately never goes deeper than superficial storytelling and grows increasingly tiresome over the relatively brief running time.
264,morbius,NEGATIVE,"The viewer struggles to care. We’re also aware that there are many, many better vampire stories than Count Dreckula here"
265,morbius,NEGATIVE,The Marvel superhero-vampire Morbius is with us. And sadly his superpower is being bafflingly dull.
266,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless don't seem particularly interested in the metaphor of mega-rich Milo seeing the rest of humanity as fuel for his sustenance, but then they don't seem much interested in anything beyond the usual world-building."
267,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Despite a fine performance from Jared Leto, Morbius is a painfully mediocre superhero origin story, delivering a shallow recreation of better movies."
268,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Its one of those movies where when it ends you go, 'Oh, thats it? I guess you just decided its time to end there.'"
269,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius is like a roller coaster without a pulse. There are highs, there are lows, there's plenty of disorientation, and by the end, you aren't upset with the ride, but largely underwhelmed because you have the sense it should have been better."
270,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Rather than a fang-tastic time, Morbius is just a soul-sucking effort."
271,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius is Marvel's most flavorless installment yet...severely lacks energy and excitement, which shows in the final product."
272,morbius,POSITIVE,A modestly scaled launch for the character that succeeds thanks to Leto's performance.
273,morbius,NEGATIVE,Morbius fails to justify its own existence.
274,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Leto certainly broods up a storm behind his veil of rock-star hair, but the movie has too little to distinguish it from the second-tier Marvel pack, ending up as more of the same"
275,morbius,NEGATIVE,"There's some kind of invisible force here, hurrying things along in the hopes of a future team-up, making sure Morbius arrives more undead than alive."
276,morbius,POSITIVE,"Logic and plot flow are generally treated like civilian casualties, but the movie, with its canny mix of whiz-bang violence, goth atmosphere, and high camp, feels pleasingly pulpy and urgent up until its last minutes."
277,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius has such an anonymous feel to it that it's impossible to work up any strong feelings, one way or another."
278,morbius,POSITIVE,"Morbius director Daniel Espinosa goes in the other direction. If it’s something you’ve seen before, like a rooftop battle, he’ll give you just enough and no more. But if it’s something new, something interesting between the characters, he lavishes time."
279,morbius,NEGATIVE,"There is no fun to be had here; there isn't any ironic or so bad its good enjoyment. It's soulless. It's oozing, tar-like gunk that has been spit out of the Hollywood machine, and you should avoid stepping in it."
280,morbius,POSITIVE,"Morbius is a film that requires one to play along and enjoy the project for what it is. While one absolutely could sit shaking their head as the film plays, it feels entirely possible to get onto the same wavelength as the project and enjoy the ride."
281,morbius,NEGATIVE,"This might have been a terrific movie if it was still 2005, but no one has asked for this kind of throwback to when comic book movies were just so mediocre and forgettable."
282,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Jared Leto's transformation makes for compelling viewing, but the Living Vampire cant elevate a disappointing story that serves as a powerful, dare we say terrifying, reminder Spider-Man is better off (and safer) in the MCU with Marvel Studios."
283,morbius,NEGATIVE,This thing will suck the energy out of audiences faster than Morbius can drain a vial of artificial blood.
284,morbius,NEGATIVE,"Morbius is a mostly unlikeable mess. The lowest bar any superhero movie has to clear, is that it should at least be fun to watch. Morbius falls at the first hurdle."
285,morbius,NEGATIVE,One of the worst popcorn blockbuster experiences in recent memory.
0,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone remains a memorable debut for one of the biggest fantasy franchises of all time. Not only does it hold after over 20 years, but this movie is still a benchmark for world building by any standard."

4,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,The Harry Potter movies are the rare series to defy the notion that the books are always better.
5,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"It's always thrilling to see kids taking matters into their own hands, outthinking their peers, outwitting adults, and defeating superior enemies."

7,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is truly a tale for all ages that will last for ages.
8,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Good film directed for a teenage audience in which not only is magic taught but also how stereotypes affect it while the film itself recreates some British stereotypes. [Review in Spanish]
9,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,The introduction to Hogwarts and the magic world is very charming and fun.
10,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"This is the world-building moment for Harry Potter, and I loved it. It's sweet and endearing...the set-up is so enjoyable to see."
11,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Harry Potter's first venture onto the screen is a solid blockbuster.
12,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Chris Columbus has created an extraordinarily detailed look that's both fantastic and yet has its own reality - exactly like an English public school, come to think of it, especially in your first term ."
13,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is, despite its trickery, that plainest and least surprising of artifacts: the work of art that is exactly the sum of its parts, neither more nor less."
14,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Harry Potter's adventures in wizard-land are cozy and comfortable in Chris Columbus' faithful adaptation.
15,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"This faithful rendition of the inaugural Potter book demonstrates that the franchise is in safe, sensible hands."
16,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,A surprisingly excellent exciting fantasy flick...
17,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Slow, but it establishes the myth, the cast and the look. And it's holding up surprisingly well."
18,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Although it suffers nominally from being over-stuffed and under-paced, it's grand and involving, with magnificent production design and special effects, and some fabulous thesps present and correct."
19,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,First Potter movie is a magical ride but also intense.
20,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,A near-perfect commercial and cultural commodity.
21,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"I hear the J.K. Rowling books are great, and on the basis of this 2001 movie I'm ready to believe it."
22,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Robbie Coltrane, Richard Harris, Zoe Wanamaker and Maggie Smith, to name but a few, all put in an appearance and it is these old hands who are the best aspect of the film."
23,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Suffering from too much fantasy over too little reality, Sorcerer's Stone sets Harry Potter up for a longer and fruitful career as a screen legend."
24,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"Because the film is so glossy, so flippant in its presentation of the world that author J.K. Rowling has spent her sizable novels dissecting, that I still don't have a good idea what all the fuss is about."
25,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"The quickest, zappiest two and a half hours of entertainment you'll ever see."
26,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Even though a few of the book's scenes have been cut, fans probably couldn't hope for a better adaptation. It bodes well for the rest of the series, when strong stories start taking precedence over set-up."
27,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"What a feast for children! Long, and engrossing. Kids will love it! Wizard!"
28,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,A spectacular franchise takes flight.
29,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"I couldn't find one mis-step, one wrong move, or one disappointment in the transition from print to celluloid."
30,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Columbus' rendition of the first Harry Potter is a slavish adapation of the book, lacking imagination or vision, though not as bad as to be insufferable to watch"
31,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"The special effects aren't overwhelming and the ideas aren't too far-fetched, but the story will reel in just about anybody."
32,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Unfortunately, many fine performances are nearly wasted by Columbus's predictable direction and an overbearing, relentless soundtrack."
33,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Even though this movie impresses and delights on it's own, it is more exciting to view it as a teaser for the films to come"
34,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Even without a whit of singing, it is the 'Wizard of Oz' of our time. (Published 12-22-01)"
35,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,A sense of loss accompanied my appreciation of the movie. The images created by my own imagination...will now be changed forever.
36,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"There's nothing more appropriate, more scary, more mysterious, more thought-provoking, more chilling, more exciting, more dynamic and more fun for the whole family than this."
37,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Though generally overrated, it's a good start to what will undoubtedly become an epic film franchise."
38,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"A Xerox copy of the book, and a copy is never as good as the original."
39,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Full of well-designed atmospheric charm, full of wondrous, expensive effects and mediocre-at-best acting, full of media hype and holiday-season merchandising opportunities."
40,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"The two biggest elements that keep the film from attaining a ""classic"" level of moviemaking have to do with its lack of sustained momentum and wit."
41,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Surefire crowd-pleaser, with a terrific, note-perfect cast and impressive use of special effects."
42,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,The story is not only faithfully but wonderfully translated to film.
43,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Faithful to book, film conjures up magical moments for fans to savor."
44,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"Like the Ewok TV movies of the mid 80s, Harry Potter meaninglessly shoestrings a new fantastical event with every scene."
45,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Sorcerer's Stone is that rare effort that successfully breathes cinematic life into a children's classic.
46,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Harry Potter manages to avoid sloppy sentimentality, but weaves the perfect balance, allowing us to not only enjoy this fabulous fantasy on a visual level, but also on a satisfying emotional one."
47,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"For the non-fan, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone serves up a memorable diversion, but it's hard to ignore the potholes."

49,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"An admirable spectacle, a real thriller for the kids and the kid in all of us, but ... straightforward and workmanlike."
50,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,What director Chris Columbus hasn't brought to it is any kind of inherent wonder or more palpable reason for being
51,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"As directed by Chris Columbus and written by Steve Kloves, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a film with no personality of its own, despite being filled with many unforgettable personalities."
52,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"Emotionally, this Harry Potter is just as inert as the popcorn-munching masses watching him."
53,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,good enough to please those who already love the books (there's a few million happy faces right there) while giving those who've resisted the Potter craze a tantalizing taste of what they've been missing out on.
54,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,A parte tcnica de Harry Potter e a Pedra Filosofal  impecvel.
55,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"The film comes off uncannily like the book; the scenes are exactly as you would imagine them. This, however, probably says more about the writing abilities of Rowling as an author than Columbus as a director."
56,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,There is such a thing as being too faithful to a novel. Many things that were amusing on the page are laborious and redundant in the film... but they're there anyway.
57,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,This whimsical film offers compelling proof that magic and movies go together like ABRA and CADABRA.
58,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"...certainly an entertaining and recommendable film, but it never soars to the heights of filmmaking or imagination."
59,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,So reverentially faithful to the first book that however you feel about the book is a pretty reliable indicator of how you'll feel about the movie.
60,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Great fun, even if it's not a particularly good movie."
61,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,The relatively hands-off treatment of any pathos is an unfortunate side effect of the film's travelogue feel.
62,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"If you enjoyed the book (or at least can take some kids with you who did), go watch it played out on screen -- just don't expect magic to happen."
63,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,My suggestion: Sit down and read the book again.
64,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"A wondrous achievement whose life, wit and vision made me grin"
65,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"The filmmakers want to show us a magical world that is, at the same time, wholly believable. They want to create matter-of-fact miracles, but what they end up with is mostly just plain matter-of-fact."
66,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Quiz la cinta no es perfecta, pero es un claro ejemplo de entretenimiento familiar y de que la imaginacin es algo de lo ms preciado que tiene el ser humano."
67,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,The blame for this is a too heavy directorial hand. Originality might have flowered under a lighter touch and the original literary work better served.
68,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,'Harry' does indeed fly--just don't expect the movie soar into the higher altitudes of imagination.
69,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,It's a good sign that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone feels rushed at two-and-a-half hours. I would easily have sat twice as long.
70,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"The tone is right, the pacing is right, and most significantly, the look is right"
71,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Columbus ... has assembled a wizardly cast and crew.
72,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"By not screwing up, Columbus has fulfilled his most important job requirement."
73,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"And yet, all things considered, the team behind this film seems to have done the best job possible."
74,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Successfully imposes its imagery of the highly fictionalized reality of Harry Potter, and capitalizes on the charming qualities of its popularized protagonist."
75,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"No se saca un 10, pero s una buena nota.... un 9 3/4 :)"
76,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Watson is witty, wise, and irresistible to watch, while Grint plays the comic relief to the many edge-of-your-seat situations that the kids find themselves in."
77,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"It's a great movie for kids and pre-teens, as well as being an enjoyable diversion for adults."
78,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"For a movie about magic, there's not much magical about it."
79,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,[A] complete triumph...
80,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"A very good movie, and a faithful adaption of the book."
81,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"the film adaptation is too faithful to the book, which may be a turnoff to the less-than-hard-core fans."
82,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,a beautifully mounted adventure movie that adheres almost fetishistically to its source material
83,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"While Chris Columbus has done what Warner Brothers, Rowling and most of her readership wanted...he's ironically lost some of the magic"
84,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"The good news is that the film is about as careful an adaptation as can be imagined, one that takes next to no liberties with the original text."
85,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,You can't expect perfection from muggles.
86,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,
87,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"Its efforts to set itself above the bar are rather admirable, if not quite charming or endearing in their eventual failures."
88,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Will not disappoint Rowling's legions of fans.
89,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Has scattered, enthralling, entertaining individual moments."
90,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Fans of the novel will have great fun reliving its adventures, and newcomers will receive a rollicking welcome to its magic-touched realm."
91,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,The grandfather and grandson sitting next to me in the third row loved this film. That says it all.
92,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"I almost wish I hadn't read the novel first. In an effort to please the Potter-philes, the filmmakers end up offering very few surprises."
93,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"I am now officially a Harry Potter fan. And that, I think, is the highest compliment a movie can get."
94,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,It delivers exactly what you would expect from a popular fairy tale in this age of digital animation.
95,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Your appreciation of the film is likely to be colored by whether or not you've read the book(s).
96,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Visually the film is just about all you could hope for.
97,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"Rarely has a movie seemed more beholden to its roots, or required so much outside help to give it its spark."
98,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Professional entertainment with just enough human moments to squeak by.
99,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"It's the smaller touches, transposed in whole from the book, that make the film as good as it is."
100,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,The narrative is a scattershot sprint through the book's events with little regard for character motivation.
101,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"""Harry Potter"" stands on its own as an accomplished cinematic achievement."
102,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"I can safely say, with nary a qualm, that if you read this book, you will, at worst, really like this movie. Non-readers might find it slow."
103,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Runs over two-and-a-half hours, but is so entertaining that it feels much shorter."
104,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Turns out to be delightful entertainment.
105,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,I doubt that most Harry Potter fans will mind a film that attends to their wishes so splendidly.
106,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"Yet for all its faithfulness to the concrete details of the book, the film is missing something when it comes to capturing the most important detail of all: its sense of magic."
107,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,It is good enough to satisfy the frenzy and hype of the moment.
108,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Like Jake Lloyd starring in a Willy Wonka remake.
109,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Here's the long and short of it: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is good, but not great."
110,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Though the film will undoubtedly please the young viewers who flock to it, ultimately many of the book's readers may wish for a more magical incarnation."
111,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,The film is what Hollywood magic is all about.
112,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"As a movie, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has no inner life -- no pulse -- of its own: It's secondhand."
113,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,The trickiest magic of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was performed by the casting directors.
114,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"It's absolutely possible to have nothing but fun at Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, particularly if you're a fan of the books and you're not looking for cinematic revelations."
115,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,The magic mostly works.
116,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"A shapely, exciting show, driven but not ruled by sets and effects."
117,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"If every movie that's greedily earmarked as a cinematic franchise could be as immaculately conceived as Chris Columbus' Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, there would be no reason to complain about the crass commercialization of films."
118,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Remarkably faithful, consistently entertaining if overlong adapatation."
119,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"As it is, Harry's gotten a ride. But at a much lower altitude than his fans might have wished."
120,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is grand, joyous, beguiling entertainment."
121,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Eye-poppingly gorgeous sets and spectacular special effects make Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone a magical experience.
122,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Despite the movie's pedestrian direction, our cranky old critic finds he can't deny kids the right to be enthralled."
123,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"The movie needs to be stronger dramatically, with a much more appealing central performance, to be the great family-oriented screen fantasy so many wanted."
124,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,They got it right.
125,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"During Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I was pretty sure I was watching a classic, one that will be around for a long time, and make many generations of fans."
126,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"It is nothing if not a stunning achievement in set design, costumes, make-up, special effects and a well-chosen cast rendering perfectly and vividly an iconic and universally renowned fantasy world."
127,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"For every flight, the film serves up equal amounts of flattened-out shortfall."
128,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Rowling's exceptional world ... transfers to the screen with a general creativity and charm in the hands of director Chris Columbus.
129,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Spellbinding.
130,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"An imaginative spiritual tale about the huge antagonisms of good versus evil that challenges us to hallow the sacred energies of friendship, fearlessness, and love."
131,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"A good, solid adventure film, no doubt one of the defining movies in the generation growing up now"
132,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"The picture isn't inept, just inert."
133,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"Moves along rather herkily-jerkily, bouncing from one special effect to another, from one character or scene to another, with seemingly little connection between them."
134,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"There's no denying that the much-hyped, big-budget adaptation will appeal to those who are already converted."
135,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,I can't really say that this film taught me anything about why this character is so loved by so many around the world.
136,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"In a perpetual state of Petrificus Totalus, Columbus contributes a pedestrian direction as if he was looking for his own place in Hufflepuff ""where they are just & loyal."""
137,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,A lavish and proficient adaptation that nevertheless falls short of the first rank of children's fantasies.
138,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,A series of rich CG adventures in a narrative that does not cohere.
139,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Retains (and in many cases, boosts) as much of the spirit [of the book] as you could reasonably expect."
140,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"It may be long, but it's not boring."
141,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"The movie version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is, as the Brits might put it, quite good."
142,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Nothing short of amazing from a visual standpoint -- what with all of the fun, amusing and imaginative details -- but isn't quite there from a storytelling perspective."
143,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,The Sorcerer's Stone is the first of what will almost certainly be the most popular series of fantasy films since Star Wars.
144,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Fans will welcome the mostly reverent translation, but the uninitiated will find the movie cramped and static."
145,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"The new, much-anticipated movie is a faithful, literal, only mildly imaginative rendering of that book. While no disgrace, it is certainly no classic."
146,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Everything else is present and accounted for, which explains the two-hour, 25-minute running time."
147,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,Poorly paced and frequently dull.
148,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Lovers of the book will find most of their favorite moments beautifully realized, perhaps even bigger and more wondrous than they imagined them."
149,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,A perfect introduction to the series for the ten or so kids who haven't read the actual books.
150,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Hogwarts and all, it's difficult to not fall under Harry Potter's spell."
151,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Potterrific!
152,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Visually stunning Harry Potter stays true to the book but falls short of classic status.
153,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"Rowling's glorious contribution to the world with the 'Harry Potter' series was in exciting a young generation to the pleasures of reading. What Columbus has managed is to get that same generation to accept blandly workmanlike, outsize Hollywood product."
154,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Enough mythic archetypes and heroic quest stages emerge here to make Sorcerer's Stone seem like Star Wars on broomsticks.
155,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves are so careful to avoid offending anyone by excising a passage from the book, the so-called narrative is more like a jamboree inside Rowling's head."
156,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,The sheer magic of the movie's spirit saves the day.
157,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"This manages to keep not just the heart of the story, but the characters and the storyline intact--and make it work on the screen."
158,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"...Columbus could have cut out the entire middle hour...and if you hadn't read the book, you'd never know the difference."
159,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"The ultimate example of a synergic multi-media construct: a familiarity with the source lends the film the depth, conflict, and resonance it fails to otherwise provide."
160,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"It does the obvious well enough, but ironically--considering the subject--it lacks the touch of magic....a picture that, while well crafted, is ultimately uninspired."
161,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"The powers that be, in their zeal to include as much from the book as is humanly possible, have overstuffed the film almost to the breaking point."
162,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Usually, films encumbered of this much hype can never live up to the lofty expectations of eager fans, but Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is, thankfully, a rare and welcome exception."
163,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Definitely worth a look-see.
164,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"A handsome, faithful, cautious film that delivers in most of the ways you'd hope it would."
165,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"It's eye-filling, well-cast, often very funny and executed with great imagination and flair."
166,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"At its best, the film's visual dazzle equals the tasty wordplay of the novel. But it is overlong, overscored, and curiously misshapen."
167,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Its success and its failure come in how literally it interprets the material -- Hogwarts and Quidditch and Hagrid and nearly Headless Nick look pretty much as you'd expect them to look, and the story goes as you'd expect it to go."
168,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"The values and lessons from the novels have translated to the film, as well as the magic."
169,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,This is the Harry Potter you imagined while reading.
170,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"A nice film with some sparkling moments; however, I had expected an overall zappier stream of wand light and more heart."
171,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"The movie has two serious flaws ... Daniel Radcliffe, as Harry, is almost devoid of personality ... [and] the film is a full hour too long."
172,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"As George Lucas did with The Phantom Menace, Columbus understood that he didn't have to make a particularly good movie. He just had to avoid making a really lousy one. And that's exactly what he's done."
173,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Entertaining on almost every level.
174,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,This film is capable of a certain brand of magic: it may turn the faithful into Muggles.
175,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,An imaginative and remarkably faithful adaptation.
176,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"No, I didn't think (Columbus) would be able to do it this well, either, but I stand corrected."
177,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Hiring nonhack screenwriter Steve Kloves (Wonder Boys) pays dividends.
178,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"If you believe in magic, you'll love Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. And if you don't, you will, and you will."
179,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"It's pleasant, and not nearly as hollow as, say, The Phantom Menace, but it's never truly captivating."
180,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"The effects are special, but too often they're the only thing that is. They seem to drive the story, instead of the other way around."
181,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"It's tremendous fun, not simply the hollow shell that most giant movies like this turn out to be."
182,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Many charms, but few surprises."
183,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,A thumping good adaptation of the work of a creative genius.
184,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Even a Muggle director can't spoil the book's magic.
185,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,I suspect that Harry Potter is appropriate for any child above the age of seven or eight... Anyone older than that will be charmed.
186,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"At almost two-and-a-half hours, this movie's a little flabby around the middle, but so is my kitty cat and I love her."
187,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Two and a half hours of pure, uninterrupted enchantment."
188,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,Columbus has done a fine job casting the major characters.
189,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"I envy kids the discovery they're about to make, about the power of movies to dominate the imagination, to air our secret fears and desires, to become cornerstones of our psyches."
190,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"Solid but uninspired, Harry lacks brio."
191,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"I was a big fan of the original book, and I was incredibly impressed with the movie."
192,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"It's way too long, there's no story, no logic, no villain, all the supporting characters are more interesting than Potter, and I learned nothing about being a wizard."
193,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Just as the Harry Potter books have reached a wide audience, so too does the movie appeal to audience members of all ages."
194,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"Gets most of the book's events in, but loses much of the lightness and charm of Rowling's vision."
195,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,A success by any standards.
196,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Brilliant, but scary."
197,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Fortunately, all hands involved in the production have faithfully observed the mantra, ""It's the book, stupid."""
198,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"Harry Potter makes a satisfactory, albeit unspectacular, celluloid debut."
199,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"The wonderfully imaginative, fabulously eccentric world of Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has been brought to the screen with spectacular success."
200,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,POSITIVE,"If the movie Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone were released in a parallel universe in which J.K. Rowling's book didn't exist, its richly envisioned world and inventive, engaging story could be appreciated in their own rights."
201,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,NEGATIVE,"As far as stuffy Oxford dramas go, Harry Potter has them all beat."
0,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"I had a lot of fun with the film, and thought Brie Larson and Samuel L Jackson were fantastic with great chemistry."
1,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"There’s not a memorable fight scene, an emotionally overwhelming moment, or even a genuinely bone-chilling, epic scene (...) Everything is just… fine. And there’s nothing wrong with that. But there’s also nothing extraordinary."
2,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,That's the stuff that superheroes are made of.
3,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,I loved Captain Marvel. It gave me almost everything I wanted and introduced us to an amazing new character. It was fun and inspiring and gave me lots of fuzzy 90s nostalgic feelings.
4,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,That moment where we see Captain Marvel in her full glory punching holes through the sky letting the audience know every girl can fly? That moment Captain Marvel absolutely delivers.
5,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"""Captain Marvel"" is a safe movie, but an enjoyable one. As much as I think it could have done more — creatively or politically — to really stand out, what we have here is likable enough."
6,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Fun reconsiderations of ancient myths and modern mythologies.
7,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"While I wouldn’t put “Captain Marvel” in the upper echelon of Marvel movies, it does really well at introducing its character and setting her up to be a major player in the MCU."
8,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The MCU’s Captain Marvel is well-paced, with a handful of moments of strategically placed humor, is solidly acted from start to finish."
9,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately, the lackluster writing and serviceable production diminish the basic thrills we expect from the MCU, making Captain Marvel a letdown, if only because of its vast potential. It remains diverting, and that's all."
10,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,There's some great visual humor. Once you get on Earth things start picking up.
11,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Despite many redeeming qualities about Captain Marvel, I found it to be a very safe film with slightly heavy-handed elements, which wasn't very exciting."
12,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,This feels like a very by-committee MCU entry. At least they actually shoot in daylight at some honest-to-god recognizable locations in this one.
13,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Carol Danvers takes us on her journey to understanding that her power does not need to be given to her; she can empower herself.
14,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"By repeatedly emphasizing resilience, Captain Marvel makes an effective role model for girls and boys alike."
15,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is a winner on all fronts, offering an exciting, engrossing standalone story while putting its stamp on the overarching MCU saga."
16,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Good Marvel formula, with some genuinely surprising twists and strong action, but a familiar groove nonetheless."
17,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Larson plays [Captain Marvel] with dignity and has a lot of charisma. [Full review in Spanish]
18,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The chemistry between Larson and Lynch propels the last half of the movie; Lynch brings depth, love, and believability to Maria."
19,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"This nonlinear narrative adds interest beyond your typical origin story, but it's quickly overwhelmed by the same shtick that's in all these movies-uncompelling action sequences, recycled villains and flat direction."
20,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,The convoluted origin story mixed with the cluttered action sequences suck some of the air out of the theatre but their take on the superhero character as both an outsider and one of us is as refreshing as it is unusual.
21,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A Marvel staple is to keep the story light and entertaining, and Captain Marvel is on par with Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man in that respect."
22,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"The production and release of Captain Marvel, the new science fiction superhero adventure from Marvel and Disney, has a number of remarkable features, but none of them involve the film's drama, action or characters."
23,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"This is Marvel's most narratively ambitious movie ... and it's occasionally a little hard to follow. But I'll take that trade, given that it's showing us something new."
24,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is the living embodiment of some of the MCU's worst tendencies, but still ends up being an enjoyable ride and a fine introduction for Carol Danvers."
25,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"While I felt let down by the lack of action, I left the theater with far more to chew on. I felt vindicated too ... She personifies strength and courage, and she's a character our daughters should see represented on the big screen."
26,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,... at some point you just wish the writers would ease up a bit and stop attempting to wring comedy out of each and every situation.
27,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"[Captain Marvel] is a blast-- a rip roarin' thrill ride full of humor, heart and guilty-pleasure '90s nostalgia that flips the expectation of an origin story genre on its head."
28,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Despite the standalone nature of this film, the first 40 minutes or so are fairly rough in design, structuring, and visuals."
29,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel may be a safe superhero origin film that provides expected action and humor... But regardless, it's still a satisfying entry in the MCU carried by an effortless star turn from Brie Larson."
30,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel is a good film that does great things for the Marvel Comics Universe.
31,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It's far from being the best MCU film, but it does a decent job on introducing on of the most powerful characters of that universe. [Full review in Spanish]"
32,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Despite the notable limitations, Captain Marvel delightfully serves its purpose both as a final cornerstone in this epic-long saga but the inspiration gained from seeing a female superhero on screen."
33,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The stakes are far too small for what should be a momentous Marvel movie, and Larson doesn't get to kick anywhere near enough shape-shifting butt."
34,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"If the emotion falls a little short, though, the movie soars with its comedy and action elements."
35,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"The movie doesn't go far enough in any direction, grounding itself in a mildly entertaining but surprisingly passé center."
36,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,A film that plays it safe with familiar formula but is so entertainingly empowering that it will inspire girls everywhere.
37,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"At a positively brisk two hours, the film has an old-school action movie vibe that is a long-overdue introduction to a character who holds great promise in years to come."
38,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Larson is terrific as Vers/Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel.
39,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A no-nonsense, punchy and fierce introduction to Captain Marvel - Who runs the world? GIRLS!"
40,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"There's a lot to like with Captain Marvel, but there's a lot to forget as well."
41,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"The direction is boring, the acting is boring, the writing is boring...this is pretty boring."
42,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"In a Marvel Cinematic Universe that has grown increasingly complex and interwoven, Captain Marvel succeeds by sticking to the basics."
43,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"""Captain Marvel"" has things going for it that elevate it a bit above the pack and provide more cultural oomph and import, but despite that, this is also a Marvel movie that feels like another Marvel movie."
44,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is an exploration of complex female strength, and while she is different from Thor or Captain America or Iron Man, she is a superhero all the same."
45,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel hits all the right buttons for an MCU origin story, while also pushing a few that make it stand out from the others."
46,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,Sometimes it stumbles upon the dullest components of a generic formula that is at the service of nonsense. [Full review in Spanish]
47,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Filled with an empowering message and sharp-elbowed clapbacks at the toxic male naysayers of the Marvel fanboy universe, Captain Marvel is just what the MCU and fandom in general needs right now."
48,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Solidly good and very enjoyable. But the film has flickers of greatness, most of which are when the film takes on the form of buddy comedy with Larson paired with Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury. Jackson and Brie have a hilarious rapport."
49,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is an enjoyable escapist movie that happens to check all the boxes for a modern progressive audience and delivers humor and action in an easy to watch, slickly-made package that maybe even the fanboys might like."
50,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Marvel's first stand-alone female hero is definitely formidable. And very likely a key component in the next movie.
51,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"After all, Captain Marvel is a Marvel Studios film with significant ties to the U.S. military. While it's nominally critical of war, its hands are filthy with government propaganda."
52,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"One of Marvel's most layered films, which only gets more enjoyable on the rewatch."
53,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Brie Larson packs a punch as one of Marvel's great new heroes.
54,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"There's a significant amount of time dedicated to an entire alien race, and for a cinematic universe that first introduced space seven years ago, it's refreshing to learn more about the races of the MCU..."
55,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Danvers' fish-out-of-water story that occurs when she lands back on earth is where this movie starts to hit its stride.
56,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"What makes the film work is that a woman claiming her identity from a life that's told her otherwise is explicitly feminist, and when Captain Marvel asserts herself it's not just with noble intent but also galvanising pleasure."
57,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,The movie's central premise asks: Who is this person? I'm not sure we get more than a superficial answer.
58,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It's a middle-tier Marvel movie. And yet I liked it a lot more than that label implies. Brie Larson, Ben Mendelsohn, and Samuel L. Jackson are so much fun to watch. Carol Danvers is so cool."
59,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel packages this dilemma in a stylish, thoughtful and funny superhero movie that's a twist on the usual origin story formula."
60,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,I like this character and I like this movie. Bri [Larson] is a square-jawed badass.
61,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,...what it lacks in wonder and awe-inducing moments it makes up for in warmth and heart and a strong sense of who Captain Marvel is and where she's going.
62,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Brie Larson soars as Captain Marvel in this uneven but enjoyable origin story and while there's definitely room for improvement as the character's adventures continue, it's a good start and well worth checking out."
63,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,I just wanted a more cohesively meaningful experience that's all - without the hollow '90s button pushing and with more cinematic oxygen for Brie Larson to breathe in.
64,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"The first half hour of Captain Marvel feels disjointed and poorly developed in part because you're dumped into an alien culture you know nothing about, which you see from the perspective of a woman who has no memories and doesn't know who she is."
65,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"I wanted to LOVE Captain Marvel. I really did. And there was a lot to enjoy, but after all is said and done, I feel a bit underwhelmed. But I did love the Flerken / aka Goose the cat."
66,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel centers a white protagonist but offers significantly more fleshed-out roles for Fury and Maria that rise above sidekick status.
67,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"After 11 years, a cynic could argue Marvel Studios is almost over-compensating for a lack of a female heroine. But you can't argue with the results - fun, action-packed and empowering, Captain Marvel is the girl power film the MCU needs."
68,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel manages to juggle being several different kinds of films at once, and the balancing act, combined with stellar performances and its unique lead hero, make a film nothing short of a triumph."
69,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,It's hard to remember Captain Marvel because it was boring.
70,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,Women and fans of female heroes deserved better than Captain Marvel (a mediocre entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe) but there's no denying that it's rousing to see a woman triumph within the context of this heretofore excessively masculine universe.
71,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is a fun, corny, and empowering origin story that feels like a bridge between the past and the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
72,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,The latest Marvel release is being positioned less as an actual film and more a wokeness bargaining chip for social media debate.
73,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"CAPTAIN MARVEL isn't bad but it isn't great. It has some excellent moments, terrific performances, and solid lines of dialogue...audiences should look forward to more adventures with Captain Marvel - but here's to hoping she soars better in those."
74,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Brie Larson as Captain Marvel is amazing from the get-go. She embodies the character in the way she carries herself, the confidence, the poise is infectious."
75,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,It's a fun movie with some great Nick Fury moments.
76,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Larson is a great casting choice to play Danvers/Captain Marvel. She has an air of power with a soft femininity underneath and a sarcastic wit.
77,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"As an action movie, Captain Marvel is really clever, with more than a few twists that'll surprise both comics fans and newcomers...the biggest problem then, is that Captain Marvel is doing so much, we don't actually get to know her all that well."
78,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It works spectacularly as a feminist text, in which a woman steps out from a patriarchal shadow and challenges a sexist male mentor in the process."
79,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"There is a fresh, creative heartbeat pumping at the center of Captain Marvel that wills it into being something special, even if it could have been somewhat more so."
80,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel can stand alone as a step forward for a film series that was long past due making one, just as it can fall short of its potential"
81,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Despite the problems, the fact that audiences are now watching female superheroes kick butt on screen is what makes this story special."
82,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Our comic book heroine has to remember her past, and you won't easily forget this fun, milestone movie."
83,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,There could not have been a better choice for Captain Marvel than Brie Larson -- she lights up the screen.
84,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"In welcoming a female hero to the big screen as the centerpiece of her own film, Marvel Studios has an expansive and fun hit on its hands. Captain Marvel offers up a complex, heartfelt tale which will leave audiences feeling inspired and satisfied."
85,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Breezy and light on gravitas, Captain Marvel doesn't shake up the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it does find a few new ways to perk up the umpteenth superhero origin story."
86,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"As the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first film helmed by a female superhero and the first co-directed by a woman, Captain Marvel has a lot to live up to."
87,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Thanos on notice!
88,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel doesn't try to say much but merely entertain us, and it reminds us that a woman is as strong as a man, but can definitely be funnier. [Full Review in Spanish]"
89,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"A very expository script, that makes use of flashbacks, with a poor representation of a period, telling a story that is not exactly memorable. [Full Review in Spanish]"
90,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,One can't quite help but feel that something this groundbreaking should have felt a bit more fresh and adventurous than it ultimately does.
91,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,[Larson's] femininity feels fresh and uncompromising and her presence is intriguingly both grounded and otherworldly.
92,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Overall, any minor missteps in Captain America aren't enough to detract from the fact that Carol Danvers is an enthusiastically essential addition to the MCU."
93,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel gives everything a fan girl or boy could want - spectacle, action, heart, and inspiration."
94,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,The type of super-heroine that cinema currently needs and fragile fanboys don't deserve
95,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"The backstory segments, which eat up the first third, are arduous, challenging your patience and viewer endurance."
96,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel, the latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, rallies itself after a sluggish start, and ultimately proves itself an acceptable crowdpleaser."
97,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Shero. Strong. Courageous. Powerful. You may be able to find flaws and nitpick at what you didn't like, but at the end of the day, Captain Marvel does its job."
98,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel is the perfect mix of humor and action. Brie Larson brilliantly brought Carol Danvers to life in this film. A must see movie!
99,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,I have to admit that I admire any superhero movie in which the hero spends at least half of her screen time wearing a faded Nine Inch Nails T-shirt
100,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,It took too long to get a woman at the head of a Marvel Cinematic Universe film and it's about time.
101,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"...just another generic, cookie-cutter comic-book movie that brings virtually nothing new to the table."
102,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,Marvel gave a pretty mediocre answer to DC's Wonder Woman with this film but at least the cat was cool.
103,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel's reflection of the female experience, along with the themes of empowerment and the general nostalgia trip, help make the result more than just your ordinary superhero movie."
104,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,There's no shortage of action scenes but they're heavy on special effects and light on emotional resonance.
105,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel satisfying but takes a minute to hit its stride
106,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"[Captain Marvel] gives young ladies another strong role model to look up, a confident and capable woman who rails against the patriarchy and the cries of ""you don't belong here"" and emerges triumphant."
107,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"... such a disappointment, though still worth seeing."
108,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The messaging doesn't need to be subtle to be important, and Captain Marvel wears its heart firmly on its sleeve."
109,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Where DC's ""Wonder Woman"" movie had intelligence and verve to spare, ""Captain Marvel"" slumps down comfortably into tired origin story clichés."
110,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The setup is slow, but comic book movie fans may not mind...the best aspect is how it subtlety connects to Avengers: Endgame."
111,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Samuel L. Jackson provides 99 percent of the chuckles here, but then, he does that in just about any movie he's in. Why is this movie suddenly a financial blockbuster? The only blockbuster-ness it warrants is the one Captain Marvel crash-lands in."
112,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,... [Captain Marvel] does manage to beautifully capture the essence of the '90s and a woman coming into her own as the superhero she was always destined to be.
113,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is a fun entry weighed down by many issues. I am more excited about the possibilities of her character going forward now that we have her backstory in the books, and I only expect Larson's role to improve from here."
114,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Besides fighting the Skrull conspiracy, she's also fighting a convoluted script. The writers do Captain Marvel no favours by tossing her origin story in the identity crisis movie blender."
115,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Larson makes something more than formulaic out of Vers's grit and impetuousness, Jackson takes the trouble this time to play the nuances of his character (since the filmmakers, for a change, have given him some)."
116,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"You know it's going to be a topsy-turvy movie year when this Marvel Cinematic Universe detractor is forced to admit he enjoyed an MCU cash cow, but such is the unlikely outcome from catching up with this sneakily absorbing origin story."
117,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A good film, some fun call-backs (especially young Nick Fury) and creates a character I'm looking forward to seeing in the next Avengers film, and that's all it needed to do!"
118,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Without the input from female writers/directors like Anna Boden, this film would not have resonated so much. Its subtle and not so subtle nuances required its creators to understand how it feels to live under an oppressive thumb in every facet of life."
119,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"They really tried to cram it all in...boring, generic, by-the-book, which is unfortunate for Marvel's first female-lead movie."
120,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Larson creates from whole cloth a recognizable template of unsinkable feminine swagger.
121,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The film isn't the marvel that's been sold, but it certainly inspires more interest in future films. [Full Review in Spanish]"
122,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Lacking a unifying vision and a charismatic star performance, this film is less a big-screen comic than a patchwork quilt."
123,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,Captain Marvel gives political cartoons a bad name.
124,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"I never really like the big ensemble Marvel films, but I often enjoy their standalone movies, and this was no exception. In fact, I loved it."
125,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is about Carol - it's not about saving the world, though that happens along the way. The antagonist, a brilliantly cast Ben Mendelsohn, is not the problem. Something much bigger - and subtler - is."
126,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"This is a new kind of female superhero, one who is fully comfortable in her own skin -- a funny, casual, wise cracking, cocky superhero. She's not overly serious, stiff, formal, or straining under destiny's weight. Instead, she's just fun to watch."
127,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Fans of the genre can breathe easy and enjoy a fantastic, hilarious adventure. [Full review in Spanish]"
128,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,The film stands only as one more step to Endgame and nothing more. [Full Review in Spanish]
129,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel almost has it all: excitement, wit, plot twists, multi-faceted villains and stunning visual effects. What it doesn't have is the gravitas of a Wonder Woman."
130,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Ignore those imbecilic MRAs, frightened fanboys, and all other insecure man-babies shellacked in misogyny: The truth is that this film is reams of fun and, significantly, no different in quality from past solo superhero flicks produced by Marvel."
131,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"It's a film that aims to show-off its girl power, and does so with mixed results."
132,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,Brie Larson seems oddly detached from the proceedings.
133,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Captain Marvel is an unremarkable, passable time killer...[Brie] Larson's performance is wooden...while the film's big action scenes are so lacking in imagination the screen often looks as though it's being continually doused in technicolour vomit."
134,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Another star is glowing in the Marvel Universe.
135,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The MCU introduces a bright, brilliant light to their universe. Captain Marvel is a complete triumph, with wit, spectacle and a sense of wonder which gives the MCU's future a compelling trajectory."
136,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Larson shines, as she's made the independently strong character her own -- serving as a role model to all young girls worldwide -- however, the scenes between her and a younger eyepatch-less Fury are my favorite."
137,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"By setting Captain Marvel in the 90s, the filmmakers did a disservice to the importance Captain Marvel can play in the larger MCU and instead gave us a forgettable origin movie-lite."
138,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Larson's energy makes Captain Marvel, whether she's pummeling villains with her self-satisfied smirk or radiating light in space like a blazing spectre."
139,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Anyone who saw Larson's finely wrought work in The United States of Tara knows she is equally adept at drama and comedy and Carol Danvers is allowed both, a rarity in this universe."
140,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It's damn fun to see Larson as a hero coming into her own, complete with 90s staples that includes a great soundtrack and references to Blockbuster, but it's hard to get truly invested since we know so little about Carol."
141,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"This prequel has a sturdy gaze, forward."
142,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"It was lacking, a bit flat, and I'm honestly concerned about how she will enter the Marvel Cinematic Universe...it's so concerned with being a feminist film that it forgets how to be a superhero movie."
143,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel could have floundered under the storytelling load it was asked to shoulder, but instead manages to (mostly) soar...a worthy choice as Phase 3's penultimate offering."
144,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A fun throwback with some nice work from Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson, as well as a great way to get audiences jazzed up for next month's big Avenger finale."
145,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"The screenplay would rather see Larson be stoic than human. She has a movie stars squint and a charisma that melts the screen, but the character, despite amiable virtue, isn't particularly relatable... there's nothing super about her."
146,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel is a film you should be proud to let your children watch. It will inspire them to understand there should be no limits on what women can achieve
147,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Larson's comedy chemistry with Jackson makes for good '90s-style buddy action.
148,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Despite some starchy Louisiana heartland sequences, this is an effective fantasy of power used with grace and without arrogance."
149,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"While Captain Marvel does very little in terms of personal growth, she does represent a certain female fearlessness that is wonderful to experience."
150,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"An almost impenetrable slog of pulp sci-fi notions of intergalactic wars and an amnesiac supersoldier, expressed without a modicum of camp or passion."
151,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,'Captain Marvel' flies onto the screen with adventure and female empowerment.
152,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Oh Captain, my Captain. Brie Larson brings humanity and depth to a role that could have been a typical super hero origin story but instead feels like Marvel is finding new ways to tell super stories."
153,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A hugely enjoyable, funny and masterfully put together offering from Marvel and Disney."
154,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,Why praise a movie that panders (with a symbolic pat on the head) to the audience it is supposed to empower?
155,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,The problem is with the corporate anticulture that controls these productions-and the fandom-targeted demagogy that they're made to fulfill-which responsible casting can't overcome alone.
156,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Marvel films should be allowed to be mediocre and confusing, but if you are invested in how Hollywood-and superhero franchises in particular-represents female characters, then the stakes of these films shift a little."
157,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,This could have been The Usual Suspects or Momento of Marvel but... they don't develop the character in an origin film.
158,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,There's not enough on the page... it's only two hours long and they kind of rushed through it.
159,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Jackson hasn't seemed this engaged in years and his repartee with Larson is delightful.
160,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"A plain, lazy and insipid entry. [Full Review in Spanish]"
161,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The strong lead and the fun, nostalgic-but-not-too-nostalgic vibe floats the movie through some iffy direction and an underutilized supporting cast. This is a good launching point for something that will hopefully be great when it's all said and done."
162,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,The likeable Larson and the digitally rejuvenated Jackson soon establish a winning screen friendship and what follows is spectacular and fun.
163,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The film is neither a masterpiece or a calamity; instead, it's a perfectly fun, entertaining installment in a larger narrative arc that's very clearly working to set up the MCU's evolution into its next phase."
164,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"This may not be the best Marvel Studios film, but I actually think it might be the best, or at least the smartest, Marvel Comics movie out there."
165,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Danvers is a hero worth stanning for. And all indications are that the movie gives her the space to shine.
166,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Nonetheless, I was prepared to enjoy Captain Marvel, the same way I enjoyed previous solo superhero films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I am not going to say I was disappointed, but neither am I going to say I thoroughly enjoyed myself."
167,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel brings a fresh jolt of energy to the MCU. If Brie Larson doesn't win you over, the cat certainly will."
168,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"21 Marvel films to get our first female-led offering was an unforgivable delay, especially for something that plays it so safe."
169,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It's perfectly possible to point out the narrative hiccups of the movie and, at the same time, to stress how important its existence and success are. [Full review in Portuguese]"
170,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Underneath the important sign of Woman and Hero is a worthy, visually appeasing and well-acted addition to the comic book genre."
171,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"There are so many great scenes here, but also an incredibly amazing moment when you see Carol Danvers throw off the last of her doubts and realize the full extent of her power and IT IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN ON SCREEN."
172,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Larson grabs the role and locks it in her soul, however, the rest of the movie isn't up to her standard. A solid, enjoyable, yet flawed romp towards the next phase of the MCU."
173,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Above all, Captain Marvel moves with a confidence that proclaims it has nothing to prove. The future of Marvel is female, and you can either accept that or get out of the way."
174,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Great visual effects and acting by Brie Larson make for an enjoyable watch that embraces a confident and smart woman character, something rarely seen in this genre."
175,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,But Captain Marvel succeeds where it is most needed. It injects a truly badass superheroine played by an overjoyed Larson into the MCU.
176,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,I thought it was perfectly fine.
177,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,It's hard to see that anyone will think this is one of the better entries into the Marvel universe.
178,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Brie Larson fits perfectly in this world of superheroes. [Full review in Spanish]
179,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,It's the entertainment industry turned into merchandise. [Full review in Spanish]
180,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,A relatively good superhero blockbuster - and it's not trying to be anything more than that.
181,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Still, the exploits of a ginger cat add a distinctive touch of comedy; and the feminist message in the protagonist's self-discovery is endearing, partly because it's never overstated."
182,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck co-write and direct this fun and funny, clever, diversity-embracing episode. Captain Marvel enjoys her powers, Larson brings warmth to the ass-whooping."
183,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,I'd like to see these actors and their characters in a better-written and better-directed film. The end result would be much more spectacular. [Full review in Spanish]
184,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The whole time watching the film, I wanted to spend more time with its hero."
185,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,The first Marvel woman to show signs of heroism is given little more than a proton blast to develop her personality.
186,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Those of us who have had our fill of this genre will still enjoy the message it sends, with great character development and interaction connecting us to the characters and creating a strong female lead."
187,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel succeeds as a rollicking-good film in its own right. Accessible to newbies and satisfying to fans, it's about time that brilliant performers like Larson were given their time in the spotlight."
188,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"When stacked up next to the MCU movies that came before it, Captain Marvel gleams with a high shine."
189,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Given the unholy mess of Carol's continuity, the film's multi-authored script makes a fair fist of delivering fragments of backstory as recovered memory."
190,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Lacking the wit and graphic oomph that sometimes rescues the Marvel franchise from terminal fatigue, ""Captain Marvel"" is yet another origin story for yet another superhero."
191,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel is a good movie that will inspire young girls to strive for the best versions of themselves. It just isn't one audiences have to fight through crowds to see.
192,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,The eagerly anticipated  Captain Marvel  features a supporting cast worthy of several sequels and a cat more memorable than its lead star.
193,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A distinctly Phase One pre-Endgame appetiser, progressive and thematically powerful in areas missing a little wonder."
194,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"If Captain Marvel had been lovingly crafted and shot with style, perhaps the void at its heart would have mattered less. But Larson's fighter pilot, turned galactic defender, is the central character a characterless movie deserves."
195,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Brie Larson is truly the Captain of this ship. And while this is a worthy voyage the story falls short of MARVEL-ous.
196,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Rather than change the way comic book movies depict women, this picture makes a standard superhero movie with a female protagonist."
197,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"This superhero movie probably does have something to prove but proves it by not really seeming to care whether it does so or not, which I think is a fantastic kind of protest."
198,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Thoroughly unremarkable, Captain Marvel wanders aimlessly through various half-baked plotlines without ever investing in its title character."
199,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel does the job it was meant to do, and I can understand how some people might like it more than others."
200,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel is an ordinary film in the place of the awesome film some of us were expecting.
201,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"All the familiarity of a Marvel movie and cleverly tied to the cohesive and expansive universe. Yet from a storytelling perspective, it's refreshingly different. Captain Marvel is an entertaining blast from the past and marvelously empowering."
202,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"I don't think that Captain Marvel is going to strike the culture like a metaphorical Mjolnir. It doesn't have to since it's a well-made standalone adventure, as well as a comfortable piece in the tapestry of the MCU."
203,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Beyond the 90s aesthetic Captain Marvel harkens back to an age in action cinema when not every single minute of film needed to be filled with exposition or seizure-inducing CGI spectacles to engage an audience.
204,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is a retro-tastic origin story worthy of its namesake, capturing the strength and heart of the comics."
205,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,It's marvelous.
206,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"An indie ethos comes to the comic-book movie, upending the origin story and offering a female superhero who throws out the boys' rule book, goes her own way, and stalks among us with easy confidence."
207,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Arrives in theaters as an adequate superhero film, complete with many of the strengths and weaknesses of the genre."
208,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"All in all, action/adventure seekers who love to be entertained, surprised and captivated will enjoy Captain Marvel."
209,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,The main strength is a core of female friendship: Carol Danvers is the only Marvel hero you could imagine getting hammered and belting out songs by No Doubt.
210,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,For Marvel there's a new boss in town.
211,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"As Marvel's first female led film, Captain Marvel is equally empowering and frustrating."
212,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Overall I think Captain Marvel is a fun addition to the MCU canon. However, I can't help but wish I liked her character more by the end of the movie."
213,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Heroes can ascend into the galaxy in a Heart t-shirt, too, a star-child in a fitted leather jacket."
214,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Usually Marvel origin films have trouble sticking the landing, but Captain Marvel is just the opposite, it feels like it takes off in the 3rd act and becomes a near flawless action movie that kicks Phase IV into overdrive."
215,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Brie Larson has such a command over our empathy, she redeems the awkwardly written moments of emotional poignancy, as well as the comic-book, time-space mumbo-jumbo that tends to make my eyes glaze over and my ears shut down."
216,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The narrative is very predictable, but it's earned through its humor and fun performances rather than its storytelling which is the formula Marvel coasted by with for years."
217,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Entertaining, witty and sincere, it only loses out on excitement because Captain Marvel is just so capable. There's always a supporting character threatening to take over though and this time it's Goose the cat: the Fury-furry relationship is a highlight."
218,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Overall the films pace did derail at times but ultimately is a strong first effort for Marvel's first Female-fronted film and has all the fun and joy we have come to know and love from the MCU. Larson's performance in this film is a high point!
219,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"As a parent, I wish a film like this had been made when my daughter was young. In Captain Marvel, Brie Larson plays a woman who comes to learn that the most important power she possesses has been inside her all along"
220,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"It really all comes down to the ho-hum writing. It's far from the worst film in the MCU, but don't be surprised if you find yourself not getting as invested as usual, or if the film ends up fading from memory faster than others."
221,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"While not the worst of the MCU, CAPTAIN MARVEL is so much less than it should've been. Even Goose the Flerken can't save it from a lacking lead performance, dull action, awful VFX, and a clichéd, amateurish script."
222,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Starts out like 'Star Wars,' morphs into kind of a Riot Grrl 'Flight of The Navigator' and then turns into 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' once it heads back out into space."
223,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A slow start, but once the movie got going, it left me breathless."
224,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,They cast Brie Larson and let the rest take care of itself.
225,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,The search for a weapon lost by all and the identity of the titular captain are the pretexts for an interplanetary back and forth and... special but monotonous effects. [Full Review in Spanish]
226,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,A meaningful tale of feminine strength -- one enhanced by rousing action and clever humor.
227,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Truly the best thing about Captain Marvel is Captain Marvel.
228,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"I liked a lot of this movie, and there's so much potential...the writing was the weakest part of the movie, but especially by the second half, things smooth out."
229,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It embraces its female empowerment narrative without needing to belabour it, putting forward an entertaining story first and lacing in its timely subtext as a bonus."
230,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A fun, adventurous space romp. I had some popcorn, I dug it. Would I want to see another one? Yes, but I have a lot of questions...good questions."
231,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel might not be a revolution, but either way it leaves one wanting to see more. [Full Review in Spanish]"
232,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"It feels like a stepping-stone movie, not the powerful one we hoped for."
233,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,Some aesthetic and narrative reluctance makes the film seem more like a rushed production to present the character before Avengers: Endgame. [Full Review in Spanish]
234,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Overall, I think that it's worth watching for sure."
235,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,The Brie Larson film has more similarities with Phase 1 MCU and it's not necessarily a bad thing. but it does feel like a step backwards. [Full Review in Spanish]
236,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Brie Larson isn't working with much, but still, does she have to deliver every line with such stony resignation?"
237,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"At this point, Marvel Studios can do no wrong and Captain Marvel is not only a great stand-alone film but also gives some established characters more depth."
238,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,The film falls short in trying to reformulate the superhero discourse via a feminine outlook. [Full Review in Spanish]
239,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Overall the inaugural take of Danvers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a fun, entertaining ride that we are definitely rooting for more as we go further into a new phase following Endgame."
240,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel does struggle to break out of the greater MCU. But what counts is that this is a story that manages to re-write the established canon of Marvel history that provides something fresh and new.
241,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,The efforts to mix massive action scenes with down-to-Earth humor is less of the smooth transition it needs to be to work and more of a jarring trek.
242,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"This is by far, the worst Marvel movie since... well, pre-MCU movies or TV like when Thor appeared on The Incredible Hulk TV show way back when."
243,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel feels like the complimentary bread before the big meal. It's bland and not what you're waiting on, but it's well-made and satisfying in the moment."
244,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel allows its indie directors to apply a touch of poignancy here, an artistic brush-stroke there - but mostly it's a by-the-numbers affair. That being said, it will most likely elate Marvel fans."
245,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Ultimately, I liked Captain Marvel, but I can see how it will piss off the hardcore Marvel fan."
246,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,I'd say it's on par with Thor: Ragnarok for being a mostly jovial entry into the MCU and I like it just about as much. I also can't wait to see what Larson brings to the table in Avengers: End Game.
247,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"An unabashed anthem about women's self-empowerment, as Vers ... claims not only the full scope of her abilities but the strength that comes from acting from her heart."
248,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Superhero portrayals are tricky but [Larson] has kind of mastered the trick, and has you rooting for her, and that's the actor's real superpower alright..."
249,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel unapologetically ejects the centralizing of the straight white male narrative, without sacrificing good storytelling."
250,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"This is more of the same, and frankly, it's getting boring."
251,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Even when a formidably female Captain Marvel finally gets her own film, it feels less like a standalone story and more like a placeholder."
252,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"While Marvel really needed to focus on building this one character (instead of many at once), the power of Larson, Jackson, and more pull the picture together."
253,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel succeeds not only as an introduction to a new Marvel hero but as a time at the movies that is consistently interested in what it feels like to be a girl and a woman.
254,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Surprisingly, the most disappointing thing about Captain Marvel is Captain Marvel herself."
255,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A middling, good-enough episode... The dynamic between Larson and Jackson is lively."
256,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It will be interesting to see, now that this origin story is done and dusted, what Captain Marvel does next."
257,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Captain Marvel isn't a pain to sit through...but such a venerable character long overdue on the big screen, the talents involved in putting her there and Marvel's rabidly faithful international audience deserved much better."
258,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Its adherence to the tried-and-true conventions of a Phase One Marvel origin story, 10 years into an increasingly complex cinematic universe, might leave you neither overjoyed nor underwhelmed, but satisfied and wondering what's for dinner."
259,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Almost everything about Captain Marvel tends towards the sub-standard, from the special effects to the action sequences, the scattershot storytelling and the slapstick."
260,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately, Captain Marvel, for lack of a better description, is just another Marvel movie - set to a robotic, unmemorable score; deeply reliant on old tropes; and featuring yet another underwhelming villain."
261,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"No, I don't want no Skrull A Skrull is a guy that can't get no love from Kree Hangin' out the earthbound side Of an Accuser's ride Trying to holler at Fury"
262,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel mixes fun and urgency with an engaging title character. It's absolutely worth seeing.
263,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,A fun science fiction action film and a sleek introduction to one of Marvel's banner superheroes...
264,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel looks to feature heavily in the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but here in the present, she more than delivers the goods holding down her own film."
265,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"...a solid, important entry in the MCU. Brie Larson and Carol Danvers are here now. We shouldn't want it any other way."
266,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Ultimately, Captain Marvel is a solid introduction to one of the MCU's strongest characters, and the cast truly make it a memorable experience."
267,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel lays exciting groundwork for something higher, further, faster."
268,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"...a story that can only be about a woman, about her frustrations and setbacks and the way the world works against her, and what happens when she stops trying to work with the world and just does her own thing."
269,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"It is unfortunate that Danvers can fly effortlessly and Samuel L. Jackson can almost recapture his younger self, but the movie cannot stretch itself to make computer-generated cables and flying cats seem natural."
270,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is a messy origin tale that struggles to figure out what to do with its main character. Thankfully, the film finds its cinematic footing late in the third act. It should also be said: the cat rocks."
271,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"...undistinguishable from the other superhero films, except that the superhero is a woman. Apparently that's are enough to satisfy the prosaic 21st Century mind."
272,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A perfectly fine Marvel installment that I can't fathom deeply loving or hating, although I'm sure many viewers will manage to do both."
273,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Captain Marvel could not be duller beside DC's Wonder Woman if she tried. Apparently, personality is not the Captain's superpower."
274,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,A fun but uneven ride.
275,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Thrilling, gripping and spectacular."
276,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"The film may be about women breaking their shackles, but the lead actress feels kept in check for much of the picture. Humor winds up being provided by Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury, heart by Lashana Lynch's Maria Rambeau, and pathos by...well, it ain't Larson"
277,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Co-writer-directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck manage to set up an engaging enough story to involve both die-hard Marvel Cinematic Universe fans as well as those who might have skipped an installment of The Avengers.
278,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel isn't exactly marvellous. But it doesn't disappoint, either."
279,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Does it work? The short answer is: yes. There's enough to keep both diehard Marvel fans and newcomers engaged.
280,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Rather than watch Danvers take her human intangibles and leverage them to become a hero, we witness as a soldier of war rejects indoctrination [to see] the cost being paid."
281,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Perhaps because it's too action-packed, this is an underwhelming origin story, introducing MCU's first female superhero."
282,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Superhero cinema has lectured us, ad infinitum, on the responsibility that is conferred by extraordinary gifts. Praise be to Larson, for reminding us that they can be bringers of fun."
283,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,She's cool and she knows it and one of the film's greatest joys is watching Larson swagger around and verbally out-spar Jackson.
284,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,[The] 90's is the perfect era for Captain Marvel to land in. It was the last time women could make noise without having to immediately hear a response from a dozen men screaming about their own alleged suppression. (The Internet ruined everything.)
285,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"When a cat, a Stan Lee-filled opening Marvel logo, a fun cameo and making fun of 1990s computer technology steal a movie you know that movie is in deep trouble."
286,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Is the movie perfect? Almost! My biggest issue-this is true-is an improper application of No Doubt.
287,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Carol Danvers, aka Captain Marvel, is a formidable force and a welcome addition to the MCU."
288,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"""But there's a surprise to Captain Marvel that only her dearest fans likely saw coming-coming into your own is fun."""
289,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Boden and Fleck leave room for quiet one-liners and sidelong glances - Mendelsohn is especially good at throwaway expressions, even in his space-lizard guise."
290,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"When all is said and done, Captain Marvel is a damn fun film which gives audiences much of what we need, even if it's not what we want."
291,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The breakout character of ""Captain Marvel"" may wind up being an adorable cat named Goose, whose cuteness seems destined to launch thousands of social media posts."
292,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It veers from space opera to buddy movie to Marvel action extravaganza, but Brie Larson's wise-cracking and a killer 90s soundtrack keep this latest MCU film watchable."
293,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"One of the sweetest - not cutesy - entries in the franchise, not to mention cheer-inducing and strong."
294,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"There's a lack of Marvel bombast, but it's replaced by a focus on natural and unforced character interaction. It's a down-to-earth film about a cosmically-powered hero."
295,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"With each phase of Marvel movies growing in scope and complexity, it's unfathomable that Captain Marvel is a step backwards for the MCU."
296,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A theme emerges of marginalized people trying to make it in someone else's world. How we get there isn't through tropes and brow-beatings, but through honest dialogue after the chase sequences and fist-fights prove futile."
297,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"The fun of 'Captain Marvel' is not so much Danvers/Marvel, but her pal Nick Fury, portrayed by the ubiquitous Samuel L. Jackson."
298,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Lord, grant me the confidence of a mediocre movie about a cosmically powered white woman."
299,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,An interesting premise... (with) nostalgic packaging. Enjoy Captain Marvel for what it is: an oddly fun character introduction with charm and imperfections all its own.
300,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"While noticeable out of their element, indie stalwarts Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck recognize the easy rapport between Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson is their best asset."
301,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It's a shame that Larson isn't given more opportunities to lend the character some heft, especially since Captain Marvel works best when it's focusing on its characters, not its intergalactic war."
302,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"It doesn't help that Captain Marvel adopts a whole slew of the MCU's other problems, from an underdeveloped villain to an avalanche lifeless CGI action."
303,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Not exactly marvelous, this origins story eventually warms up, takes flight and wins us over."
304,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Larson has to play a character who is both reclaiming her past and discovering her future. It's a surprisingly complex role which may be why some fans have been put off by it.
305,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A couple of clever twists that keeps it involving, with some pointed but never pushy references to refugees and how we learn who to trust as we learn who we are."
306,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"In the grand scheme of the Marvel Universe, however, ""Captain Marvel"" feels like a supporting player, not a featured attraction."
307,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,There really should be an extra gold medal issued for the way the film successfully brings in the equally topical matter of attitudes to refugees when we were least expecting it.
308,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Larson and Jackson also share easy-going chemistry that sets the general tone of the film quite early on.
309,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"'Captain Marvel,' set in the mid-1990s, is not the best offering from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's like an old car on a freezing, winter day. It sputters when you start it, but gradually warms up and hits on all cylinders."
310,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Finally, the MCU has someone who fights like a girl."
311,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Captain Marvel tries to zip and zap its way into the pop-cultural canon... Some, I suppose, will enjoy the frenzy, but for me, the point turns out to be inadvertent: Incessant movement doesn't necessarily get you anywhere."
312,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is by no means the next best superhero movie. But it is a lot of fun, and a solid foundation for a character with plenty of potential in the MCU."
313,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel is one of the best films in the Marvel Comics franchise.
314,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"It's too bad [Captain Marvel's] debut movie isn't better, and less convoluted, because the character seems to have great potential, and Oscar winner Brie Larson looks like a great fit for the role."
315,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,[T]he film isn't so much about conflict as it is about discovery.
316,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Beyond the praiseworthy change of paradigm, Captain Marvel is a pretty classic bet and in certain aspects conventional. [Full Review in Spanish]"
317,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Aren't these movies supposed to be interchangeable? Isn't that the point?
318,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"""Captain Marvel"" end ups somewhere between empowering and entertaining, because when you strip away the bombastic comic-book accoutrements, ""Captain Marvel"" is a simple story of female strength, friendship and identity. Sign me up."
319,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Somehow, I feel like [Captain Marvel's] going to pound Thanos straight into the ground. I would enjoy that."
320,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It sort of feels like second-rate Marvel -- certainly not horrible by any means and clearly entertaining enough, just not up to the lofty standards we've come to expect. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
321,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Just when I think my MCU exhaustion is almost complete, Captain Marvel arrives to pull me back in."
322,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"However, [Captain Marvel's] best quality lies in how the film seeks to emulate the way comics managed to comment on the current social and cultural landscape. [Full Review in Spanish]"
323,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"As it is, Captain Marvel is more a reminder of Marvel's early work (think the first Captain America or Thor) than its more recent output (Black Panther or Infinity War)."
324,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"In the end, it has a girl-power zing that lifts and exhilarates."
325,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,The tone is equidistant between the farce of Thor: Ragnarok and the seriousness of Black Panther. [Full review in Spanish]
326,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Ultimately, Captain Marvel is one of Marvel's most baffling missteps."
327,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"[Larson] quickly comes into her own in a role that, despite the limitations of the franchise, never quite conforms to superhero conventions."
328,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Plenty of humor and action make this an immensely entertaining thrill ride. Captain Marvel is a blast.
329,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"With Captain Marvel the studio combines the two elements, resulting in one of the more breezily enjoyable and emotionally satisfying of the franchise."
330,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,A rare misstep from a franchise factory that otherwise strides the movie landscape so assuredly.
331,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,The whole thing is so consistently entertaining it practically doesn't matter that not every piece makes as much logical sense as it probably should.
332,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"We wanted less of all that faux mythology, more of the hand-to-hand fighting and coy pop cultural references, and more opportunities for Brie Larson to show off her comic timing. Captain Marvel is good, but could easily have been better."
333,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Though there's plenty of punching and brrap-brrap-pew-pew, the true emotional core is her friendship with Rambeau, and if Captain Marvel inspires just one girl to become a USAF pilot, it'll all have been worth it."
334,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Nicely balancing the Earth-bound elements with epic cosmic action, Captain Marvel is yet another winner from the house of M."
335,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"What really stands out about Captain Marvel, then, is its approach to its hero's origin. Unlike Marvel's typically heavy-handed exposition, this movie only hints at a backstory it never truly reveals. The restraint is refreshing."
336,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Let loose, as she does, and relish in the unbridled power of this new MCU entry that wrinkles the blueprint with fantastic feminine wiles."
337,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,Captain Marvel is bright and entertaining on a basic level. But it's also something we may not have seen before: An MCU film that's kind of forgettable.
338,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The film, unlike many in the genre, actually builds in intrigue as it powers on."
339,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"By no means bad, Captain Marvel is still an enjoyable space-slash-superhero adventure, but Carol Danvers might have been better served by being introduced a little earlier in the release order."
340,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel may be good enough to satisfy the series' built-in audience, but might disappoint anyone expecting more."
341,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Look, while this is less inventive than you hoped (and prayed), it is an improvement, with Larson proving she can more than carry a film of this type."
342,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"The characters display recognisable humanity which is the film's balance but not often enough or convincingly. There's something dark and empty in all the fanfare and fuss, and it seems aimed solely at an audience that grew up in video arcades."
343,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,A somewhat fluffy final act still offers enough distaff derring-do in plenty of time for Friday's celebration of International Women's Day.
344,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The film looks great on an IMAX screen, Larson is sublime and the fantastical plot is buoyed throughout with lots of good-natured humour - reason enough to wish a return engagement for Captain Marvel."
345,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,'Captain Marvel' earns its stripes in the MCU.
346,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"The characters are undeveloped, the outlines of this universe are vague and uninteresting, and the less said about the multiple attempts at humour, the better."
347,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Marvel are kind of like the New England Patriots of movies now, dull even when, or maybe partly because, they're so consistently successful."
348,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is such a welcome and appealing addition to the Marvel universe that I wish she could be added, retroactively, to all of the extant ""Avengers"" movies."
349,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Her quest is a well-executed one of universal appeal, so much so that the fact she can shoot proton beams seems of little import."
350,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A surprising amount of humor served with a heaping of 90s nostalgia, but suffers from a less-than-perfect origin story."
351,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Years from now, chances are that when people sit around and talk enthusiastically about that movie with Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson, the subject is most likely to be Kong: Skull Island."
352,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Plenty of other Easter eggs abound throughout, but the only wish I have is that this and future MCU movies remember to keep the human side as strong as the super heroics and not devolve into murky mayhem when the action hits."
353,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It's not the best Marvel movie, but at the centre of it all is the terrific Larson, every inch the heroine we wanted her to be..."
354,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel didn't markedly improve the experience for me. I enjoyed it well enough. It felt...familiar.
355,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,Captain Marvel rates a C. It's distinguished from other MCU movies by its female lead. Otherwise it is way too ordinary and middle of the pack.
356,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"You would think that after 21 feature films, Marvel would have perfected the superhero origin story formula, but to Brie Larson's detriment, this time they forgot to add ""character"" and ""personality"" into the mix. [Full Review in Spanish]"
357,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It's hard to find much of anything too disappointing about Boden and Fleck's new film. The only real letdown might be fans' realization that they still have to wait another few months till ""Endgame"" hits theaters."
358,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"The feature's gender politics feel like a bit of a pose: too superficial to convey the source material's fiercely feminist mythology, and too desperate for applause for it to be regarded as sincere."
359,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A fun '90s-set adventure that delivers action, emotion and humour in the mighty Marvel manner."
360,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,An uneven but passionate and energetic introduction for a figure some have called the most powerful hero in the MCU.
361,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is anchored by even more unabashed girl power, managing to stand strong alone while whetting your appetite for what comes next."
362,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Soars as an origin story with heart, cheeky humor, wit and warmth, zingy dialogue, punchy action, colorful characters and a hero--heroine--who breaks the glass ceiling on two worlds."
363,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,This woman is a candidate for genuine heroism. Yet there's a fundamental dissonance between the depth of her plight and the shallow disorganization of the script...
364,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A funny and fun introduction to a mighty Avenger. It has flaws, but they only stand out because other MCU films have done these things better."
365,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Larson is really terrific. She's confident, smart and never comes across as too full of herself. But what I love most is her relationship and camaraderie with Jackson."
366,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"You will believe that Brie Larson is, indeed, a superhero, and CAPTAIN MARVEL is superb entertainment."
367,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"It's not fair to give ""Captain Marvel,"" a perfectly passable popcorn movie, the full weight of the obscenity of this cinematic gender disparity. But after this wait, society deserved better."
368,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,It's not going out on a limb to say Goose the cat is reason enough to see the movie multiple times. But there are other joys in Captain Marvel. An abundance of them.
369,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,Far from marvelous...a stumble in Marvel-Disney's plan to conquer the cinematic universe.
370,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"To be blunt, it's insulting that Marvel felt simply making its first leading woman ""one tough chick"" would be enough to placate female fans."
371,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Larson can turn a moment as slight as walking into frame and blowing a strand of hair out of her face into an uproarious, powerful visual beat."
372,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"We may learn Vers' true name and how she came to be a Kree warrior but we never learn enough about who she is, flaws and all, to make her anything more than another interchangeable hero in a shiny suit."
373,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Eleven years after Robert Downey Jr. first strutted on the silver screen as Iron Man, Marvel has finally given us a female superhero. Brie Larson shines as Captain Marvel."
374,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,The Marvel Cinematic Universe's first woman-driven movie has taken much too long to arrive. That it is here at all is cause for celebration. A pity then that it sticks to the tried and tested.
375,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"I's fun for fans, a place-setter for Endgame, and if you don't care about seeing Marvel raise the bar past Black Panther, you will get your money's worth."
376,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"At full strength... Captain Marvel is a goddess emitting her own light - an astral version of Liberty at the battlements, sublime and terrifying."
377,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"[B]lockbuster spectacle, eye-popping visuals, thrilling action, & heroes we care about & root for... with overt & subtle points about equality, diversity, & the power of family & belief..."
378,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Turns out the MCU's glass ceiling was just the floor for unexceptional but entertaining enough superhero movies.
379,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Cynical fans may think Captain Marvel is too little, too late, yet it convincingly makes the case she arrives right on time."
380,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is another winning entry into the MCU, with Larson emerging as a highly appealing kick-ass heroine with brains to match her brawn."
381,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Without making a fuss, it's a movie about regaining oneself and one's values in a universe where the boys are busy fighting."
382,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,This is mostly seriously entertaining. It's certainly on par with the 20 films that preceded...
383,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Even when mindless digital mayhem threatens to swamp the movie, there's always a complex narrative point."
384,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,The film works quite well. [Full review in Spanish]
385,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,To watch another obscure hero beget a franchise-building smash-hit movie means marveling at Marvel once again.
386,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Any actor who can still project warmth, humour and believability through the storm of effects and the sheer predictability of superhero plotting deserves a lot of respect."
387,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel isn't just a feat of directing and good writing, the acting is some of the liveliest in a Marvel movie."
388,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"In a world where Marvel films are now Oscar contenders and we've seen nearly every Avenger onscreen in the same movie, how do we set the baseline for what a good Marvel film is?"
389,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"While it's impossible to look at any Marvel product without considering how it fits into the larger puzzle, ""Captain Marvel,"" much like last year's ""Black Panther,"" deserves to stand on its own as much as it can."
390,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"While it may be a Marvel movie, it shares a deeper spiritual DNA with movies like Memento and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, than it does, say, Ant-Man."
391,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Brie Larson steps into Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel's boots for the first time and it's a blast to see the Room Oscar-winner transform into a superhero in this solidly entertaining, if regrettably conventional, origins story."
392,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Vital to the success of Captain Marvel is Larson, whose amused intelligence warms the movie through like Carol's hands heating a kettle."
393,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,This is a stand alone film that actually stands alone. Captain Marvel may not be subtle or stylistically innovative -- or even particularly great for that matter -- but I'll still be excited to show it to my daughter once she's old enough.
394,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Marvel takes a feminist leap forward with this superhero movie to change superhero movies forever.
395,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"'Captain Marvel' is Imperfect, Sardonic, and Every Bit the Success it Needed to Be"
396,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Without qualification, Captain Marvel is a brilliant, blazing success and the perfect lead-in to the Avenger's Endgame."
397,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Larson... is terrific. She gives Vers a swagger and a smart-alecky veneer.
398,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel is an important film because it presents a show sophisticated enough to frame this transcendence and make it enter through the big door in the pop culture. [Full Review in Spanish]
399,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Despite its flaws, Captain Marvel cements the desire to see Carol Danvers in action again. [Full Review in Spanish]"
400,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Bizarrely, Captain Marvel is less interested in fleshing out its own hero than it is in filling in the blanks of the MCU."
401,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,This plays like the kind of generic comic book movie that was in vogue 15 years ago.
402,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"""Captain Marvel"" is a hero that Marvel fans deserve, even if the movie that introduces her isn't everything you want it to be."
403,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Imagine The Long Kiss Goodnight being retold around a campfire by The Guardians of the Galaxy... (a) heartfelt action-oriented bundle of Marvel joy... the best version of Captain Marvel for the screen.
404,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The closest thing to an agenda this movie may take on is simply having more female representation, while not compromising the comic book story of Captain Marvel in the process."
405,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The girl power (and grrl power) ring out loud and clear, if a bit hollow."
406,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"An eminently fun and thoroughly enjoyable picture that ... establishes Captain Marvel, in the supremely qualified hands of Larson, as an Avenger nonpareil."
407,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Perhaps in the hands of other directors, Carol might turn out to be an eye-popping force of costumed law enforcement. However, for her first adventure, ""Captain Marvel"" leaves much to be desired."
408,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,It is such a shame this film isn't a little better...t's decent mid-ranking Marvel. Most fans will find something to like. It's got a great cat. No horses are scared.
409,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,Captain Marvel seems to hold itself to no higher standard than the absolute minimum that people tend to expect from an entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
410,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It's fun! A lot of fun...sometimes too much fun. But doesn't stick the ""origin story in the thick of it"" film that Deadpool did. I wish the film had just picked a tone and stuck with it."
411,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,A flawed but compelling introduction to Marvel's newest hero.
412,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,Hearing a Nirvana song in a Marvel movie on the day Luke Perry died felt like a dire reckoning for this Gen Xer.
413,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A new kick-ass heroine, a cat called Goose and Samuel L. Jackson as a young Nick Fury are the best things about this spectacular action-packed adventure from the Marvel cinematic universe."
414,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The movie alternates between the exhaustingly samey (crash, bag, flash, kerpow) and the refreshingly let's-shrug-and-have-some-quiet-moments. It is a relief to have a skilled under-actor in the main role."
415,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Despite its flaws, the film is a decent superhero flick, and has the potential to take off to new heights with more character development."
416,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"An MCU future centred on Carol Danvers could be a bright one indeed. But as Captain Marvel reminds us, especially with its haunting glimpse at the haircuts of 1995, some pasts need to be overcome on the way to greatness."
417,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It's cool...I mean, it's enjoyable...I mean, it's pleasant, but I feel like the emotional impact you take away from the movie relies on the emotional connection you bring into the theater with you"
418,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,We are still at the point where the visuals of such a powerful female hero are rare enough that its sheer existence makes you giddy.
419,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel has given us an engaging female character that does not come off as an empty 'agenda'. Larson's magnetic performance paired with an entertaining buddy-cop romp and some character moments makes this another strong entry into the MCU.
420,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Captain Marvel effectively makes feminism a target, a goal to be achieved in ways that feel more self-congratulatory than progressive."
421,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Brie Larson was already my hero before Captain Marvel so this only reconfirms the obvious.
422,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Along with champions of parity in film and strong female leads, fans of Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson, cat fanciers, and lovers of fun everywhere, you'll want to be there for it."
423,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Though it still falls into the usual origin story problems, Brie Larson elevates this 90s buddy film as an entertaining and enlightening addition to the MCU."
424,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"...hopeful, colourful, space opera-ry comic book escapism, with a pumping '90s soundtrack and, perhaps most importantly, an awesome ginger cat called Goose."
425,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"This superhero flick is basic but still engrossing, enthralling, and rewarding on many levels."
426,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,The final 30 minutes of Captain Marvel contains some of the most bad-ass action sequences in any Marvel film to date while also conveying a message that is inspiring to women of all ages.
427,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It's meant to show the lighter, more family-friendly side of the MCU, and to that extent, younger viewers should be pleased. But there are no lump-in-your throat moments in ""Captain Marvel."""
428,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The end of the film will make you want to cheer, relegating most of the film's more uneven moments to footnotes."
429,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is a perfectly decent mid-tier superhero romp with some uplifting and positive female messaging in the second half... For a movie, and a character, carrying some serious expectations, it's a little bit of a disappointment."
430,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Let's just hope that Avengers: Endgame follows through on something Carol Danvers asks herself: ""what happens when I am finally set free""? Yeah, you're kind of screwed Thanos"
431,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A delightful entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe filled with action-packed fight sequences and chases, as well as a reminder to never let anyone hold you back from your full potential."
432,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Good thing it's still March. ""Captain Marvel"" would have made a weak start to the summer blockbuster season."
433,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,You could ding it for convoluted plotting and a retro style that flattens the usual Marvel fireworks. But a dynamite Brie Larson gives hell to cosmic villains and sexist trolls. And an orange feline named Goose is the best movie cat ever!
434,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Captain Marvel, down to the eye-rolling musical choice of No Doubt's 'Just a Girl,' cares far more about lecturing audiences than entertaining them. And boy, does it show."
435,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is not going to reinvent the wheel, it's not going to break new ground, but it does what it needs to do."
436,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Brie Larson has the credits for the role and trained extensively for it, but she is hampered by her character having amnesia through part of the story."
437,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel has a playful vibe and yet nails the full-on female-empowerment/empowering action thriller aspect as well.
438,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Neither a blast from the past, nor an inspiring glimpse into the future, at the end of the day it's just another Marvel movie. And not a particularly good one, at that."
439,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,The middle section has a lot of exposition and plot but then they bring it around and end it on a really positive note
440,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,It only took the Marvel Cinematic Universe 21 movies to finally make one led by a female superhero...Marvel has perfected the manoeuvre at the first time of asking with Captain Marvel.
441,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"By now, MCU fans know the drill: stick around for the end credits, and you will not be disappointed."
442,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"This is a time-shifting space story teeming with deception at every turn, and, yet, when it reaches its finale one feels, quite frankly, un-involved by it, hell, even bored."
443,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,A great superhero origin story hobbled by the corporation using it for their own selfish purposes.
444,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is a riotous explosion of fun and spectacle, with a badass heroine at its core."
445,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Its mid-'90s setting gives the film retro flair, and its girl-power soundtrack, blasting Garbage and Hole, will win over any '90s girl's heart."
446,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Marvel not only finds itself lagging behind DC with its first female super hero, but utterly losing the contest. ""Captain Marvel"" is a boring mishmash of ideas from a score of other movies and franchises..."
447,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is a fresh addition to the canon, taking it in a needed new direction, with a great soundtrack, the right kind of girl power, solid cast, exciting action, and the right dose of intelligence and humour."
448,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Powerful, brilliant and simply Marvelous!"
449,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"As shaky and unfocused as Captain Marvel often seems, it manages to reach its destination with confidence. In the end, Larson sticks the landing, albeit with something more muted than absolute triumph."
450,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"""Captain Marvel"" is a lot of things: a buddy movie, a '90s nostalgic coming-of-age tale, a superhero origin story. This mix can be jarring at times, but it hits its stride when the movie tells a story that doesn't follow the blueprint of most MCU titles."
451,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"They've made a Marvel blockbuster that, like its central character, is entirely free of personality."
452,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"[The] filmmakers think that in order to make someone look strong, you need to make them emotionless, and I just don't agree."
453,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"If Captain Marvel is indicative of the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, then the franchise is more vital and impressive than it has ever been."
454,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It rises to the occasion with strong performances and with its directors' willingness to slow down and take their story seriously, balancing humor, action, and exposition in a carefully calibrated package."
455,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A plucky and pleasing, if predictable, excursion that burns brightly, if briefly."
456,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It moves quickly and avoids the bloated running time that has plagued many of these films, it has some nice bits of humor sprinkled throughout and, most importantly, the strong and entertaining Brie Larson performance."
457,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"""A bit of a misstep at a very crucial time."""
458,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It's a rare performer that can get pathos and humor in the right combination, but Larson excels at it."
459,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel lives up to her billing as the heroine we need right now, even if she's not one fragile fanboys deserve."
460,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"CAPTAIN MARVEL may not be the most thrilling adventure in the MCU filmography, but it's likely to please a ton of fans looking for a little bit of empowerment and inspiration."
461,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel takes the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a bold, fearless new direction. It's a roaring adventure, knockdown funny, and threads together multiple storylines brilliantly."
462,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Makes the blending of its first leading female superhero into its male-dominated stable seem as natural and effortless as it ought to have always been.
463,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It's fun, witty, never less than enjoyable, but also somewhat slight."
464,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It's a sci-fi heavy actioner, which is at its best when it's being sincere and is a good first step to rectifying some of the problems of the franchise's past."
465,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Fun, but... Carol Danvers deserved to fly higher. [Full review in Spanish]"
466,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Larson does get a few opportunities in Captain Marvel to be that regular, flawed-but-strong human-there just aren't enough of them, and they're hardly the focus of the movie."
467,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,The trap the filmmakers set for themselves is this: They set out to make a girl-power statement - but feared acknowledging any differences between men and women.
468,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"It succeeds more as an amusing fill-in-the-blanks Marvel backstory provider than a confident, stand-alone tale of a woman discovering her fierceness."
469,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel feels as substantial as any of the other stand-alone Marvel Cinematic Universe films, even if it does things at a more relaxed pitch."
470,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Larson makes it fly with her easy charm, grungy style and credible, sometimes effortless ass-whooping; one thing's for sure, she shoots straight to the top of the league as Marvel's coolest customer."
471,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It's not too long, not too self-important, and benefits from the craft and talent of a cast that includes Annette Bening, Jude Law and Ben Mendelsohn."
472,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"The raw material is all there, but filmmaking itself does not yield any truly thrilling, resonant moments. The action sequences are rote, at times almost muddled."
473,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is here in the form of Brie Larson, who is kicking intergalactic booty and I'm here for all of it! The chemistry and banter between Danvers and Fury is quick-witted and a highlight"
474,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"While her story asks some important questions and tackles significant issues, it may not become a universal rallying cry. But with the most impressive powers in the universe, she is well-suited to lead our heroes into the next phase."
475,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"With a well-written story, dedicated and fun performances and a sprinkling of '90s nostalgia, Captain Marvel is a gratifying ride with a badass woman at its heart."
476,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Larson carries a difficult role with a grin and a swagger that matches Tom Cruise's in Top Gun.
477,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel is a must-see superhero film. It pushes all the right buttons in bringing the audience to the edge of their seat and rooting for the newest and first standalone female superhero film in the MCU.
478,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck have managed to create a rousing, fun superhero saga that earns the right to be viewed without needing conditions, asterisks or equivocation to evaluate its artistic worthiness - both alone and as a part of the MCU."
479,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,More of a solid building block for future endeavors than a must-see solo adventure.
480,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Brie Larson is an inspiration here. It's rare to want to stand up and cheer in a superhero movie, where your protagonist is literally superhuman, but she brings that out."
481,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"This outing may be more of a Meh-vel than a Marvel for me, but I'm confident that a film worthy of the hero at its centre will arrive sooner rather than later."
482,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,It might seem like damning with faint praise to say that the most exciting thing about Captain Marvel is the anticipation it inspires for what's coming next. It's not.
483,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel takes a while to find its pace, but when it does, it doesn't disappoint."
484,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"This movie is no Black Panther or, if we're expanding the field of comparison, Wonder Woman... Luckily, Captain Marvel doesn't have to be better than all of the MCU's previous films to be something enjoyable."
485,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Survives a bumpy ride of origin story tropes and sci-fi jibber-jabber to become a supernova of a superhero movie sure to shake up the MCU.
486,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel has all the usual MCU humor and action (with a few surprises), and plenty of girl power moments in Larson's strong performance."
487,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"""Captain Marvel"" mostly plays like a perfectly solid addition to this massive commercial franchise. It's fun and breezy but also a tad familiar."
488,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"An important Marvel movie that connects a lot of dots the MCU has generated over 20+ films. Not one of the TOP tier MCU films, but a solid and entertaining one nonetheless"
489,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"While a solid film, Captain Marvel seems more intent on setting Carol Danvers up for future appearances than making her first film truly great."
490,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Liberating. Cute. Forgettable.
491,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Absolutely grounds itself in the '90s, even evoking a riot grrrl-adjacent feeling, buoyed by a soundtrack that features almost exclusively rock fronted by female voices - a reminder of an era that showed so much promise for brash, loud women."
492,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Brie Larson is fantastic as Captain Marvel. She delivers in all fronts in this trippy, fun origin story. [Full review in Spanish]"
493,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Samuel L. Jackson, Goose, Lashana Lynch and Ben Mendelsohn frequently meet performance challenges to remind us that Marvel's heart still beats steady and strong..."
494,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"These are all good reasons to root for Carol as she becomes the newest member of the MCU. But Captain Marvel doesn't highlight any of them in a rousing, snappy way."
495,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel, like many MCU movies, sometimes labors under the weight of having to tell its own story while still connecting to the larger, ongoing saga, but it has no issues with justifying its main character."
496,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It's a real treat to see Carol Danvers find her footing and her wings, so to speak, while at the same time Nick Fury is taking the first steps toward becoming NICK FURY."
497,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel offers its audiences a chance for escapism, and to imagine a world in which one woman can change the course of the future."
498,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"In short, Captain Marvel is a blast."
499,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Brie Larson delivers a performance full of depth and nuance that will stand as one of the best in the superhero genre.
500,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"'Captain Marvel' flies high and fast, but struggles with narrative turbulence."
501,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,The movie's treatment of its source material is clever.
502,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"How's Larson? She's more than good enough for this job. It's not her loosest work, but few, if any, good actors deliver their loosest work in a superhero movie."
503,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,Only the most dedicated Marvel fans will follow this Captain.
504,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"The character, even when kicking ass, is a total bore."
505,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It takes a few wild swings for the movie to finally land, but once it does, it becomes a fun, brisk, and engaging movie - though one nestled comfortably within the Marvel movie formula."
506,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Although Larson's heroine is still a work in progress, ""Captain Marvel"" lays a solid foundation to follow her wherever she flies next."
507,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Captain Marvel ultimately feels more obligatory than inspired, a movie that basically gets the job done and little more."
508,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"When she's not trying (and failing) to do a Robert Downey Jr impression, Brie Larson's Captain Marvel is a hero who doesn't hesitate - which is pretty darn cool."
509,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel is a lot weirder and more cosmic than you're probably expecting.
510,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,...Captain Marvel gives us a new superhero as the Marvel Cinematic Universe pushes forward.
511,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"In the age of the dour superhero flick, Captain Marvel strikes a pleasing chord, at once delivering levity, gravity and spectacle."
512,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Praise be to Goose the Cat; I look forward to his inevitable solo film.
513,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"She's the hero for anyone who has ever been told they couldn't, and who works out they could, and should have a long time ago. Higher, further, faster? Damn straight."
514,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"With an endearing heart that's impossible to resist and a glorious leading lady steering the ship, 'Captain Marvel' is an imperfect but supremely entertaining blast."
515,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel is enjoyable enough as popcorn entertainment.
516,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Marvel has been churning out million-dollar superhero blockbusters for over a decade now. They know how to do them - and you know how to watch them.
517,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Brie Larson [as Captain Marvel] proves all the doubters wrong...while continuing her ascension as a cultural and feminist icon.
518,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Mendelsohn and Jackson are both so good, they're basically worth seeing all on their own."
519,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Like its tough, smart heroine, ""Captain Marvel"" dances to its own beat; it's an origin story that isn't structured as an origin story but gets there all the same."
520,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"The humour is nicely played, with some neat '90s gags to accompany a grungy soundtrack."
521,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It's always tricky introducing a new character, especially the most powerful one in the Marvel Comics roster - and Boden and Fleck, and Larson, do it with high energy, good humor and intelligence."
522,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"It's everything you might expect a sci-fi superhero movie to be, if you hadn't seen one in a long time."
523,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,The first female-led movie of the MCU deserved more.
524,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"The picture is not dull, exactly, just mundane, marked by unimaginative plotting, cut-rate villains, a bland visual style and a lack of elan in every department."
525,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is not the blunt-force challenge to the accepted norms that Ryan Coogler's Black Panther came to represent, but it's a potent statement of intent."
526,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It's a monumental milestone for Marvel and while not as strong as some of the more recent Phase Three entries, it still soars to new heights for the universe at large."
527,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Just as the Marvel makers wanted, I left the theater pleased to have met Carol at long last, and eager to see her again."
528,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Like THOR and IRON MAN, this oddly Phase One-ish MCU movie is entirely dependant on its charismatic cast."
529,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"It's not only heroes who can have superpowers, movies can have them too, and you can add ""Captain Marvel"" to the small list of those that do."
530,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"In any case, Captain Marvel is an entertaining new part of the saga."
531,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A fantastic hero debut within a spectacular and twist-filled, 1990s-set adventure."
532,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"While the film suffers from bland direction and a convoluted script, Brie Larson's brash performance makes Captain Marvel a worthy addition to the MCU."
533,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,This is not another cheap girl-power cliché; it's an explicitly feminist apotheosis.
534,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is an entertaining, quality MCU instalment. But those who were hoping that this Marvel landmark would knock their socks off might be left feeling unsatisfied."
535,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Marvel films are all about anticipation: they're designed to make you crave the next helping before you've even swallowed the current one. But this is the first in a while that I've found myself immediately hungry to revisit.
536,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Captain Marvel's big screen debut puts a fresh spin on Marvel's Phase One origin story formula.
537,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,The film doesn't pay nearly enough attention to Danvers's crucial emotional metamorphosis from dual-identity self-doubter to fearless warrior battling to keep Earth safe.
538,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Overall, it's a strong superhero origin film, though I found myself more excited to see Carol grow as a character after her origin."
539,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,And entertaining and visually dazzling story that is weighed down by being both an origin tale as well as the appetizer to a highly-anticipated film finale
540,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,She's a welcome addition to the aforementioned Marvel family tree; let's just hope she's given a sturdier branch next time.
541,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,Phase 3 might be the strongest slate of any film franchise ever. Captain Marvel reinforces anything Marvel touches turns into marvelously satisfying experiences for fans.
542,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Engaging, entertaining and empowering, this new and terrific iteration spotlights a strong, complex, fearless woman finding her voice, power and place in the universe."
543,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,This film's message is all about empowering women. It's almost as if every single scene is a conduit for positive female thinking.
544,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"After a slow build-up, once Captain Marvel starts to grasp her powers and untangle her past, the film soars, delivering in terms of epic action and emotional resonance."
545,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"While Captain Marvel follows the Marvel formula, it takes full advantage of the twists and turns available when your hero cannot remember her past."
546,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is light, funny and quite satisfying, though it may leave you craving something a bit more substantive."
547,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"Captain Marvel is full of hysterical funny moments, gorgeous visuals and is an action packed spectacle. It is one of Marvel's best films, Brie Larson is perfectly cast as the relentless ""Avenger""."
548,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"[Boden and Fleck] have brought off something exciting, embracing the Marvel house style and, within that, crafting a tale with enough tricks and moods and sleight-of-hand layers to keep us honestly absorbed."
549,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,"A blast from the past, literally. For the most powerful super hero in the Marvel universe, I'm not quite sure this movie lives up to the hype...yet. Girl power, yes. Earth shattering plot? No. But you forget how talented Samuel L. Jackson is."
550,captain_marvel,POSITIVE,There is a sense here though that the MCU formula is now being relied upon to paper over some of the cracks in the storytelling.
551,captain_marvel,NEGATIVE,"Scenes between Fury and Larson's Carol Danvers, rediscovering her human past, are oddly inert, and the film's much-vaunted feminism, promised in months of run-up advertising and interviews, gets short-shrift."
0,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Here's a film that is offensive only in how inoffensive it proves to be.
1,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Feels like an elegantly made - the cinematography and score are top notch - night time soap opera.
2,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"At least, the film goes out of the way to show the use of condoms."
3,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"If this is love, no thanks."
4,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"In terms of story and character, this film is in desperate need of a safe word."
5,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Overlong, too clinical in design, and based on lowest common denominator entertainment (or so I'm told), Fifty Shades of Grey still manages to be engaging, funny, and unexpectedly human."
6,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Given that this is her second film, [Sam] Taylor-Johnson directs the film with taste and care by focusing on the interactions between Ana and Christian rather than the sexual side of the story and the film looks stunning."
7,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Fifty Shades of Grey will draw you in out of curiosity and possibly hopes of a good movie, then leave you wondering why you agreed to such a thing in the first place, much like the main character."
8,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Funny that no one seemed to understand in the making of Grey that watching two vaguely defined characters engage in ceaseless rounds of conservatively filmed grimaces and stifled moans gets tiresome quickly.
9,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"There is little more critical than to say a third of the film had people laughing at dialogue, and the other two thirds wiggling in their seats, not from discomfort or innervation, but from boredom."
10,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,You've seen worse; you've imagined better.
11,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Nice as it looks, this movie tastes bad..."
12,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Most of the actual sex has less erotic value than what can be found on late night HBO, and it certainly doesn't hold a candle to the graphic content of the novels or the erotic-charged hype surrounding the film."
13,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,You would've put the book down after reading the character's name on the third page: Anastasia Steele? Puh-lease!
14,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,[General audiences] might need to be handcuffed to their seats and wonder how something so wildly popular could be so stiflingly unerotic.
15,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Every fiber of my being is screaming at her to send this man packing.
16,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"The dialogue is terrible and Dornan's Grey is so humourless that any vaguely funny lines fall utterly flat. On the plus side Johnson does her best with what she's been given, Ana is a Thomas Hardy fan, and Grey has a nice kitchen."
17,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"The entire palate of the film was cool and gray, which doesn't do much to incite passion. and I don't think we should blame the actors."
18,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Fifty Shades of Grey is that hot date you bring home to discover (s)he's a cold fish between the sheets.
19,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"This is worth going to the cinema for, leave your expectations behind and relax and enjoy a visually beautiful film."
20,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Sometimes a book should just remain a book and in the case of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" that is exactly the case."
21,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,[Fifty Shades of Grey] simply never gets anything right.
22,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Among the many mind-bogglingly implausible fantasies Fifty Shades of Grey sells, the one I think that most accounts for its popularity is the promise that shame of sexual sin can be alleviated by surrendering to it more fully."
23,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"I'm really worried about the fact that some people (especially girls) regard Mr. Grey as an object of desire, as some sort of ideal man. [Full review in Spanish]"
24,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"The second half of the film devolves into something that resembles tedious, melodramatic daytime TV."
25,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Grey is not a character, but a cluster of clichés... [Full review in Spanish]"
26,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"It's superficial, it's manipulative, it's off-putting and embarrassing. But there's no denying that this says something about the moment in which the book was published and the movie released."
27,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"The script is abysmally bad, filled with Shakespearean dialogue such as ""I won't touch you until I have your written consent"", and ""I don't make love, I f***... HARD"""
28,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Dakota Johnson shines in this clunky, boring and domesticated sex ruse. [Full review in Spanish]"
29,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"There is an awful lot of rose-tinted nostalgia here for a time when women sat passively while powerful men threw wealth at them, but the interesting difference here is that the power dynamic between Red Riding Hood and the Wolf shifts."
30,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Shortage of exotic shenanigans apart, artist-turned-director Sam Taylor-Johnson has delivered a decently acted and technically well-made adaptation of what remains a fundamentally silly and, at times, simply rather unpleasant story."
31,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"I've seen way worse movies aimed at men and boys, so I think everyone can chill out about a mediocre movie aimed at women."
32,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"It may not be your conventional Valentine's Day date movie, but it looks set to give audiences more pleasure than pain."
33,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,The retention of the style of the book and its settings merges with a cinematic story more focused on buildup than execution.
34,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"The film's a hell of a ride, often a fun and thought-provoking one, even though it's all such camp."
35,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"In the run-up to [Fifty Shades of Grey]'s opening, I was surprised at the promotional efforts of NBC's ""Today"" show in the daily banter of the hosts and beyond."
36,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Fifty Shades of Grey is so much smarter than its source material, but smarter in this case doesn't mean better. Not where it counts, at least."
37,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Alas, I was a reluctant Dominant because the movie itself is such a mousey, uninvolving little thing that somebody had to step up."
38,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,The most anticipated release of the year is not much more than a spanking great bore.
39,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Then the lights went down, and guess what? Fifty Shades of Grey turned out to be not just entertaining-at least until the clunky, exasperating final minute-but it also knows exactly what it's doing."
40,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Not as dirty as we were led to believe by the ads.
41,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Girls memorize the lines! But it's not a 'Rocky Horror' type cultural event; it's a lukewarm soft-core-porn soap opera-basically 'Pretty Woman' with spanking.
42,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,I wish it had either been much better or much worse.
43,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"In the lacking of an engaging subjectivity, the narrative of sexual awakening falls flat."
44,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"While the film is arguably no better or worse than its literary source, it does shatter the fantasies of sexual desire and sexual pleasure constructed within the novel."
45,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"A guilty, if not particularly memorable, pleasure."
46,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Funny (often intentionally!), ferociously unsexy, and roundly entertaining from beginning to end."
47,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"It's a warped, disturbingly abusive adult fairy tale from start to finish."
48,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Certainly there is an audience out there for this kind of story, and with any luck neither you nor I will ever have to interact with it."
49,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,This is a wannabe tragedy (with whips) about the knightly failure to commit to the maiden's romantic narrative.
50,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Fifty Shades of Grey delivers, however ponderously, on its promise of pop transgressiveness."
51,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Ultimately, Fifty Shades of Grey spends two hours describing a relationship that is bound to fail and doesn't even seem all that fun while it's occurring."
52,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Fortunately the two leads have real chemistry. Dornan makes Christian less creepy and more angsty than on the page and Johnson brings a surprising depth to Anastasia. They also know how to play certain scenes for laughs, making the film come alive."
53,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Let's talk about Dakota Johnson... she's the perfect blend of innocence and confidence; a stealthy heart-breaker who at first comes across as mousey and innocent, but suddenly and convincingly becomes confident and coquettish."
54,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,I was more aroused by the immaculate shine on Christian's piano than anything in his boudoir of bondage: a set designer must have spent hours buffing those ivories.
55,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Rather than anything to do with sexual connoisseurship or philosophy in the bedroom, all that comes across through Fifty Shades of Grey's absence of erotic heat is a lust for the appurtenances of luxury, something that's more commonplace than singular."
56,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"It's cheap, misogynist, Z grade exploitation masquerading as the romance of a woman trying to tame the ultimate man, who by all accounts should be alone left to his own demented fantasies"
57,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"It's not overstating the case to say that Dakota Johnson achieves stardom with this role. She mines moments of humor that help offset the soul-searching and weeping, and she's appealing without being impossibly beautiful."
58,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"This movie is a mess. It's glacially slow, boasts a laughably clichéd soundtrack -- Beast Of Burden, anyone? -- and is plainly a cash-grabbing set-up to promote a full trilogy."
59,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Yes, there's tons of nudity, but erotic? No."
60,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,This alien quality is what makes Dornan so effective as Christian.
61,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Fifty Shades of Grey is one of the landmark works of the new millenium, the novel that proved definitively Americans will suffer through anything for a few fleeting moments of titillation."
62,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"One day, it may become a bad movie/cult classic -- the kind of film that people go to laugh at, like Showgirls. But for now, it's so boring it feels endless."
63,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,The film is about the best adaptation that could have been drawn from this rather dull source material -- at least until it slows to a crawl on the deathly serious and dull home stretch.
64,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,Unexpectedly delightful.
65,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"It was less terrible than I feared, but still fell well short of being good."
66,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"When Christian sweeps the demure Anastasia off her feet and into his world of penthouse-and-helicopter luxury and sadomasochistic sex, what lies in store is two hours-plus of glossy tedium."
67,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"There's a really funny, sexy comedy here that might have been wonderful, were it not also stuck with being an adaptation of this loathsome novel."
68,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Both actors are trapped by the rigid banality of their characters, and they fail to manufacture any chemistry -- without that heat, this is just a story about a contract negotiation."
69,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"When you take a close look at Fifty Shades of Grey, it becomes painfully clear that it's basically a plethora of sex scenes strung together with a bare minimum of support."
70,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,It's pretend bondage. Caffeine-free Diet BDSM.
71,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"It's rare when a movie is better than a book, but in this case, only because this movie is better than its source material doesn't mean it's good."
72,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"If they added foreboding opening and closing monologues by David Duchovny, the whole thing could easily be mistaken for a long-lost episode of Red Shoe Diaries."
73,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Johnson brings some wonder and vulnerability to her part, but even with a listenable soundtrack, the song that most comes to mind is Peggy Lee's ""Is That All There Is?"""
74,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Grey may be crass and calculated, but Johnson saves it from being completely forgettable."
75,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Without the baggage of having read the book, the synopsis or even the film's Wikipedia page, Fifty Shades of Grey unspools as a surprisingly engaging story about sexual naivety, concepts of consent and, ultimately, power."
76,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Actress Dakota Johnson brings humor, sensitivity and vulnerability to Anastasia, making her the clear breakout performance of Fifty Shades [of Grey]."
77,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,A monumentally boring motion picture.
78,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Who would have thought, a Twilight ripoff actually being inferior to its already inferior inspiration."
79,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"... isn't nearly as terrible as E.L. James' novel would make you expect. There's perverted, like the sado-masochistic sex games played by tycoon Christian Grey, and then there's perverse, like the pleasure of watching trash so glossily compacted."
80,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Basically, they made a lousy, mid-2000s-era Katherine Heigl romance with a handful of explicit sex scenes spliced throughout the familiar clichés."
81,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,A syrupy softcore melodrama with perhaps too much dialogue.
82,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,My biggest grip with the film was that I didn't find the two leading characters all that interesting.
83,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"He's a wealthy tycoon named Gray who takes a woman to her limits. I'm talking, of course, about '9 1/2 Weeks.'"
84,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Perhaps it's time for all of us to recognize that fantasies come in a great many more than 50 shades - and that they're not real.
85,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"One suspects that Taylor-Johnson was never free even to push at the edges of sexual representation, and the film's lack of explicit imagery and grit is one of its disappointments."
86,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,What emerges in Fifty Shades of Grey is perhaps the best finished product that could rise from the depths of a compromised starting point.
87,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,Taylor-Johnson has made a film that is both sexy and stylish.
88,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"I fault no one for whatever it is that gets their crank turning, but if this movie is working you need to take that thing out for a spin far more often."
89,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"It's a bondage movie without much perversion, a love story without much passion, and ultimately, a film burdened with expectations it could never fulfill. It never quite hits as hard as you want it to."
90,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,I can only say that boredom set in early.
91,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"While there's some meat to Dakota Johnson's role of the ingenue, Jamie Dornan is given absolutely nothing to work with for most of the film."
92,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"In the end, Fifty Shades of Grey isn't so much terrible as it is timid and tame."
93,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"The much-hyped film adaptation, in which James was closely involved, sticks closely to the novel, but is both strengthened and weakened by what director Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel decided to omit."
94,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"What is this thing called love? That's a question asked by Cole Porter. In 'Fifty Shades of Grey,' the initially virginal heroine has a very different if not entirely unrelated query: 'What are butt plugs?'"
95,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Oh...my...god.
96,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Sam Taylor-Johnson's movie adaptation gets so caught up in the intrigue and melodrama that it never really finds its groove. Even the film's raw sex appeal is lacking, which just leaves a poorly plotted story and laughable dialogue."
97,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,...a lukewarm exercise in timidity that - if not exactly embarrassed by its subject matter - is extremely wary of diving too deeply into it.
98,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" which gingerly crosses over into the questionable subject mark, may not be the film some of the book's readers were hoping to witness."
99,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,There is a very good chance that I will see nothing worse all year. I'm pretty sure I will see nothing more brain-witheringly stupid and boring -- or less sexy.
100,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,The movie is simply a profitable pop culture movement with the only good thing coming out of it is Beyoncé's remix of 'Crazy in Love.'
101,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"If this fanchise plans on being the ""Saw"" of Valentine's Day, I hope the next installment doesn't torture the audience so much."
102,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,This is a film that should have gone direct to Cinemax.
103,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Fifty Shades the movie seems destined to inspire more eye-rolling than lip-biting, even if there's no denying that its protagonist is better served by the film than the book."
104,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Think of it as the ""Downton Abbey"" of bondage, designed neither to menace nor to offend but purely to cosset the fatigued imagination."
105,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"A wimpy, wounded billionaire sadist - correction ""dominant"" - with a cleanliness fetish and no friends stalks with gifts a passive-aggressive virgin."
106,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,It realizes this story is ridiculous in ways the book itself never could. It has an actual sense of humor.
107,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"It's supposed to be a romance, but plays like a long, boring business meeting in which the naughtiest bits are raised not in the bedroom, but the boardroom, where contract negotiation stagger on over the proposed merger of his manacles to her wrists."
108,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,This adaptation of EL James's BDSM potboiler struggles to make a spanking cinematic silk purse out of its notoriously tin-eared source.
109,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"A charm-free hero with control issues and a passive, fretful heroine have coy and tediously vanilla pretend-sex. This is meant to be erotic?"
110,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Panders to Twilight's housewives and teens demo using that story's template, but with sex! Kinky sex! The sex is incredibly boring and the alleged ""romance"" between a naïve college student and her stalkerish zillionaire suitor is deeply troubling"
111,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"As silly and, yes, sanctimonious as this adaptation is, it deserves mention as one of the first major studio releases in ages to promote sex over vigilante violence or superherodom ... And that, in a peculiar way, makes the film a refreshing departure."
112,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"A desultory dud, that swaps out [the novel's] prolonged and explicit intercourse for tame (conceived as tasteful) inserts, padded out by the troubled relationship between a straw man and blow up virgin."
113,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Beneath its curious surface, ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is an uninformed and unrealistic ""romance"" set in the BDSM world that dangerously dramatizes sexual violence and glamorizes domestic abuse."
114,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"I expect most viewers would rather see the filmmakers take this franchise in a different direction. How about Fifty Shades of The Grey, with the two vapid protagonists forced to contend with Liam Neeson and a pack of ravenous wolves?"
115,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Such silliness.
116,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,A monochromatic misfire featuring only one shade: blushing pink.
117,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Frankly, after watching the film, I felt ambivalent. The film's not exhausting, at least. It's not quite fifty shades of dreck."
118,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Perfectly capturing the tone of E.L. James' sensational best-selling novel, this tale of control, sex and submission is tantalizing, titillating and provocative"
119,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Part of the appeal of the tawdry romance novel is that the visuals are left to the imagination for its legions of fans, whose expectations for steam and sizzle will inevitably be left unfulfilled here."
120,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,It's an episode of Red Shoe Diaries with a major studio budget. It's a Lifetime movie with insider art pretensions. A Harlequin romance with anal play.
121,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"It's been said that the movie contains 20 minutes of sex; if this is the case, it must contain at least 40 minutes of Ana biting her lip or putting a pencil in her mouth."
122,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"There's no escape from the silly, pulpy predictability of Fifty Shades of Grey."
123,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,The best they can do for dirty talk sounds like 'wear the panties your mother laid out for you.'
124,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Presumably the sequels will explore forbidden taboos like ""character development"" and ""plot."""
125,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"A cynical, perfunctorily directed, guileless, sexless and artless re-tread of the novel - the worst kind of fan, and potential franchise, service."
126,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"A relatively chaste, arguably feminist interpretation of the BDSM fairy tale."
127,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"""Fifty Shades of Grey"" has turned out to be more like 50 shades of blah."
128,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"The sex scenes merely serve as a basis for the real appeal of the film, that is, the shifting emotions and back-and-forth of ""who's got the edge?"""
129,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"[I]t promotes female ""empowerment"" within the safe culturally approved traditional female roles as submissive and as seeking a powerful Prince Charming to rescue them from ""ordinary"" lives."
130,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Still not bad for being based on a book with a narrator who exclaims ""jeez"" while in the throes of orgasm and talks about her ""bottom"" like she's a 4-year-old."
131,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Who would have imagined that a movie about sex could be so boring?
132,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Anastasia Steele becomes a woman. Christian Grey? Bimbo. It's a gorgeous conceit, and I can't wait to read a raft of writing by smart female essayists about the film, and its cheeky subversion of its tin-eared source material."
133,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately for the Fifty Shades of Grey movie, a solid cast, good director and unique premise only help to expose the inherent weaknesses of the source novel."
134,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Less interested in sexual power dynamics than in lassoing this guy into what the movie perceives as ""normalcy."""
135,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,The film doesn't culminate in anything. It's a bunch of scenes that end before any kind of satisfying conclusion.
136,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"There really isn't enough meat here to cobble together a real movie, but you can't blame Taylor-Johnson for not trying. She somehow gives it all a movie-type sheen."
137,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,If soft core porn is your thing go for it but that's about all you'll get. Not a lot of grey matter used writing the script of Fifty Shades of Grey.
138,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"I guess what I found to be so surprising is how a movie about weird, erotic, passionate sex could wind up being so dull."
139,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Were it not based on a massive best-seller, no one would have made such a thematically reprehensible movie. If you think rape is a turn-on, this is the film for you. Personally, I'm perfectly happy not to be included in your ranks."
140,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Attempts to capture the appeal of a classical Victorian romance - tragedy and all - but has neither the complexity nor the historical context necessary to live up to its ambition.
141,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Thelanguage of 50 Shades is actually of the financial deal and the job interview, replete with the kind of counter-intuitive sloganeering we hear in advertisements. So much of what Christian Grey says is what money would say if it could talk."
142,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Every line of dialogue is loaded. Loaded like a diaper.
143,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"An Ambien pill...While a follow-up is likely, it's a bit presumptuous, and if it's anything like the first installment, it's about as welcome as a splintered paddle."
144,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"What's worse than the boring sex scenes, however, is the rest of the boring movie."
145,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Bland and dull, except for the rare moments when it is unintentionally hilarious, all Fifty Shades has to teach the curious is that it doesn't matter how many shades of grey you use, you will just end up with a drab, colorless blob."
146,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Given the constraints and need to please its considerable fan-base, this sleek, fairly trim and occasionally sensual adaptation is the best imaginable outcome."
147,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Lackluster take on best seller is way too graphic for kids.
148,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,It is unashamed tosh but at least director Sam Taylor-Johnson has fashioned it into tosh with a touch of class.
149,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Like some mutant spawn of THE BACHELOR
150,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Yawnography.
151,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Neither a camp laughing stock nor a shocking study of sexual obsession, Fifty Shades Of Grey starts well but fumbles in the dark. See it for Dakota Johnson. For the rest, find your safe word."
152,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Absolutely ludicrous, dramatically clumsy, fifty shades of wrong, but...If audiences can cool their loins long enough, they may have a productive think about the nature of their desires..."
153,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Sleek sets, sadomasochism, a few spankings and an overall blandness"
154,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,...a passable adaptation that could (and should) have been much better...
155,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"""Grey"" has about as much steam as a day-old cup of Earl Grey. The sexual scenes are ordinary and fail to push the envelope; they definitely do not arouse any viewer."
156,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"After all the hype, it's impossible not to expect steam from this adaptation of E.L. James' mommy-porn bestseller"
157,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"In the annals of sexually-charged event cinema, ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" barely lights a candle let alone combusts with unbridled forbidden passion."
158,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Fifty Shades of Grey may be the first film in history made specifically for the purposes of hate-watching.
159,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"To put it plainly, there's nothing redeeming here - not the acting, writing, directing or even the, um, ""action"" scenes, during which you just feel bad for the characters, actors and everyone on the set who had to be a part of them."
160,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Hopeless twaddle, but sleekly made and sometimes funny. An honorable effort, and better than it needed to be."
161,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"It's a bland experience occasionally interrupted by bouts of nudity and related naughty bits. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)"
162,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Although Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan lack erotic chemistry, this fetishistic fantasy remains faithful to the provocative novel."
163,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,Will you sign the necessary paperwork to enjoy Fifty Shades of Grey?
164,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,... had James been overruled more often Fifty Shades of Grey could have been something genuinely extraordinary: an adult blockbuster in every sense.
165,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"If this was written by Adam Sandler, groups of offended ladies would be outside theaters protesting with pitchforks and torches. Also, we wouldn't be laughing as much."
166,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"I never thought I'd say this about a bigscreen adaptation of 50 Shades Of Grey, but it's true: the damn thing's just not trashy enough."
167,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"""50 Shades"" has its sexy moments, but never attempts to be romantic, and isn't ambitious enough to deliver romance and sex appeal simultaneously. ...Jamie Dornan is given the thankless task of playing a monotone misogynist."
168,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Nobody sweats or pants or experiences onscreen ecstasy, which is presumably how a movie about violent sex manages to avoid an NC-17 rating, but the result feels like 50 shades of beige."
169,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Isn't the stuff of bondage and discipline, sexual role play, silky blindfolds, and whips and floggers supposed to be, well, exciting?"
170,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"My mind screams Noooooooo! This movie sucks and is offensive on so many different levels, but damn my lady parts....Jamie Dornan's abs beat me into submission. Every time I think about them any common sense I have goes out the window."
171,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Fifty Shades of Grey is by no means a masterpiece. Yet there are moments where it rises above the material thanks to the lovely Dakota Johnson who is luminous, and a director that helps paint a very pretty picture."
172,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Fifty Shades isn't ha-ha cheesy fun. It isn't tee-hee quasi-dirty fun. It's terrible. On almost every level.
173,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Fifty Shades of Grey only has one shade: tedious self-pity. The other 49 shades promised in the title are missing from the movie version of the infamous novel.
174,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"I have seen more heat and more skin in late-night offerings on Cinemax. I've seen more realistic romance in young-adult movies, and I've seen better acting by furniture."
175,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,How can a movie this controversial be this painfully boring?
176,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"While the movie talks dirty, what materializes on the screen is soft focus and barely soft core."
177,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Advertises itself as edgy and titillating, but proves fatally tepid and boring."
178,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Jamie Dornan is going to get crushed for his performance here, but it's not all his fault. His character, as it's written, has the charm of a toaster. There's not much Dornan can do about that."
179,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Johnson has a natural warmth, intelligence, and humor that come across on screen and go a long way toward making the movie less silly than it could have been."
180,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Anastasia is a problem. Christian is one, too. We spend most of the movie trying to figure out which character is the bigger one."
181,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"We're constantly told in life that women long for humor, tenderness and honesty, yet that doesn't seem to be the case here."
182,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Dornan simply doesn't have the ability to truly offer up deep, unimaginable pain and self-loathing. He's just not that talented an actor, and if the part were recast for the next two movies, no one would bat a blindfolded eye."
183,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,A generic romance cynically engineered to appeal to the lowest common denominator of female fantasy.
184,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Johnson is rather sweet, though, and if she played a role that required her to look more than alternately smitten and poleaxed, she could score big. But now that Fifty Shades is poised to be a franchise, will she have that chance?"
185,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Johnson does a lot of moaning and groaning...leading me to visualize a director wearing plus fours with a megaphone...out of camera range, yelling, ""Moan!"" and ""Groan!"" The idea of sitting through two sequels is almost more than one can bear."
186,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"The director of the much-anticipated adaptation, Sam Taylor-Johnson, made what could have been a trashy TV movie into well-conceived cinema."
187,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"...director Sam Taylor-Johnson attempts to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, but while she leavens the experience with some well mined character humor and gives the production a glossy sheen, you can only put so much lipstick on a pig."
188,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Yet the film's biggest problem is its two stars. Despite all the ripped abs and exposed breasts, blindfolds and cuffs, there are few sparks between them. Without that, Fifty Shades of Grey feels as cold and sterile as Grey's sleek penthouse."
189,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Those who take their significant others to see it this Valentine's Day may find the evening ends with a soft kiss on the cheek rather than a night full of boot knockin'.
190,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Confunde fetiche com abuso.
191,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Sam Taylor-Johnson's Fifty Shades of Grey is total trash. Noble trash. The amusing kind of trash, actually."
192,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,No one said the masochism part of the story in Fifty Shades of Grey had to do with what the audience would be put through.
193,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,The dashes of momentum are just a tease. It's hard to remember the last time this much sex was this tedious.
194,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,I'll go see the next movie quite happily.
195,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Sam Taylor-Johnson's film version is neither as bad as it could have been nor as good as it needs to be.
196,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Actors Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan make an appealing couple and battle mightily against the flat, linear plotting, though when the story ended inconclusively I wasn't eager to follow them through the inevitable sequels."
197,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"In the interest of consumer reporting, I'll say this: The book isn't better than the movie, and the film isn't better than the book."
198,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Oddly enough, Sam Taylor-Johnson's movie version of E.L. James' phenomenal sexy best-seller begins as an intriguing, exciting, even eroticizing experience before its S&M engine jumps the rails."
199,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,[A] supremely silly film.
200,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"In the end, there's nothing here we haven't seen before. But there's also nothing as agonizingly awkward as James's prose."
201,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Some aspects might be off-putting, but the actors and filmmakers handle the topic in a surprisingly tasteful way."
202,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Leads Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, both of whom spend the majority of the film supposedly desperately longing for each other, have so little chemistry that it gives the sexy goings-on a rather clinical feel."
203,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,A great movie? Not even close. Is it the best movie that could have been made from its source material? It probably is.
204,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,A flaccid S and M movie that's more infuriating than titillating? Happy Valentine's Day.
205,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"The likably coy Johnson has no chemistry with the dreary, self-serious Dornan. He's a casting disaster ..."
206,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,The sex scenes are the best bit because the story is so abjectly terrible.
207,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"The biggest disappointment for those non-readers of the book is the feeling of is-that-all-there-is? A bit of rope, some hanging around, six smacks - it's tame enough to make Tyrion Lannister of Game of Thrones smirk."
208,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"All in all, this is really tame."
209,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,The movie as glossy as a Topps trading card. Real BDSM enthusiasts will roll their eyes at its chaste exploitation. But it's got something going on.
210,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"When you look at is as nothing more than horny housewife erotic fiction, it serves its purpose."
211,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"""Fifty Shades of Grey"" the movie, for the record, is not quite as bad as ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" the book. But that's not saying much."
212,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Fifty Shades of Grey only has one shade: tedious self-pity. The other 49 shades promised in the title are missing from the movie version of the infamous novel.
213,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"In the closing moments, ""Shades"" goes from being dull to disturbing, but only slightly."
214,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Sam Taylor-Johnson's drably competent adaptation of EL James's appalling mucky novel offers Nitrazepam for the libido throughout.
215,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"While Fifty Shades Of Grey is a memorable and society-shifting cultural event, it's in no way a memorable movie."
216,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Despite what you might fear, the movie is not torture. And even if it doesn't inspire lust, you will breathe a warm sigh of relief, thinking: This could have been so much worse."
217,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Creating a genteel R-rated film from a very X-rated book is like making a Mamma Mia! movie without the songs.
218,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"""Fifty Shades of Grey"" should be fun and frisky and, most of all, hot. Instead, it is a reserved, sanitized, overinflated downer, as sterile as Christian's sleek luxury penthouse."
219,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Unofficially titled, So, Can I Spank You or What?, Grey leaves you with a question you don't want to ask after a movie or after sex: Is that it?"
220,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"About an hour in, it finally dawned on me that perhaps the movie was giving me insights into masochism after all. As the minutes slowly, painfully ticked by I came to accept my punishment."
221,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,What's important is that the novel began life as Twilight fan fiction. That tells you everything you need to know.
222,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"It needed to take the plunge, strengthen the sexual moments, and submit to the book's ""mommy porn"" reputation. Instead, it played it too safe."
223,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"For a movie that traffics in the promise of sexual adventure, it's founded upon a woefully conservative narrative."
224,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"There's a big problem with ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" and his name is Jamie Dornan."
225,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,The book has a reputation for being a compendium of ridiculous lines. The film is entertaining because it understands the humour of the material and milks the exchanges with knowing delight.
226,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"""Fifty Shades of Grey"" turns out to be an intriguing tussle - not in the sack, or in the Red Room of Pain, but in its internal war between the dubious erotica of James' novel (the first of three) and the far craftier trash offered by the movie."
227,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"I'm not going to pretend I didn't like this movie, just as I can't pretend there's nothing wrong with it. But try thinking of it this way: It's an event movie that's also a relationship drama, and that's rare."
228,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"I expected a lot of things from ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" but I didn't expect to be bored."
229,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"An unashamed and genially preposterous fairy tale, a kind of ""Cinderella"" with restraints, ""50 Shades"" is about as believable as ""Jack and the Beanstalk,"" albeit considerably more kinky in intent."
230,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Vainly seeking to reach the widest possible audience, the makers of this exercise in banality stripped it of almost anything that could cause offence."
231,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"For a movie where people are naked for a large chunk of time and play at bondage and dominance (without ever really seeming all that committed to it), it sure is boring."
232,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"It may be perfectly sufficient that, above all else, Fifty Shades of Grey captures the shallow essence of its source material."
233,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,These two star-crossed lovers have a lot more to negotiate than just the path to true love.
234,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Fifty Shades of Grey feels like two, distinct films grappling for dominance over the screen: one a sensual and stylish romance, and the other a numbingly explicit Harlequin bodice-ripper brought to life."
235,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"I can't help but feel that if this was subtitled and in Polish or French or something, then critics would be losing their collective minds over it."
236,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Colorless
237,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"There's undoubtedly more nudity than in a standard 21st Century Hollywood movie, but it's less explicit and less passionate than what Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone got up to in Basic Instinct more than 20 years ago."
238,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"What's troubling and somewhat dangerous is that underneath the twisted sex, this story contains the same template of every aspirational romance."
239,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"I'm shocked - shocked, do you hear me?!? - that the film version of E.L. James' Fifty Shades of Grey is such a dull, decorous affair, about as erotic as an ad for Pottery Barn. Strictly intended for gluttons for punishment-by boredom."
240,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"It has an impressive performance from Dakota Johnson (daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, granddaughter of Tippi Hedren.) But it doesn't really feel like a date movie."
241,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Overall, no-one's going to be needing a cold shower after this. However, half a glass of something beforehand in the company of like-minded friends is definitely recommended."
242,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"There is no denying that Fifty Shades, for the most part, is nonsensical and absurd, but it's undoubtedly good fun."
243,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,The only thing Dakota Johnson can't pull off is her character's over-dramatic name - she introduces herself as Anastasia Steele like an apology.
244,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"[Taylor-Johnson] has very professionally rendered this potent rubbish much less ridiculous, much more of a marketable proposition, than could have been expected."
245,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Maybe in future installments there will even be something that resembles a plot. For now, the entire movie is about as sexy as a root canal."
246,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"I wouldn't say that Taylor-Johnson has made a good movie from ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" precisely. That's asking too much."
247,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Johnson has a great knack with comedy, salting silly lines with witty humor, and giving ridiculous moments just the right roll of the eyes."
248,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"It looks and feels like a sequel to Twilight, with deadly dull talk about S&M replacing endless consternation over turning into one of the undead."
249,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Think World of Interiors meets The Little Book of Bondage, and you may get the picture, which starts out hilarious, becomes ludicrous and finally dubious."
250,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Obsessed with money, willfully wrongheaded about sex and crippled by its own construction, Fifty Shades of Grey is too many kinds of awful to work as anything but accidental sociology: We get the smut we deserve."
251,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"It proves that age-old saw that great books rarely make great films, whereas barely-literate junk can turn into something ripe and even electric on screen."
252,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"My God, this thing goes on. By the time the two get busy in Christian's ""playroom,"" the oomph has gone out of the whole erotic setup ..."
253,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,The film's intense commitment to being dull makes you long for sparkly vampires and werewolves.
254,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"If this were a parody of romance, the film might be considered valid; but somehow the cast and crew appear to treat the venture as realistic."
255,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Easily amongst the seven or eight best Hollywood productions ever made about a woman contemplating whether or not to sign a dominant/submissive contract.
256,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,A limp bore.
257,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"""Fifty Shades of Grey"" might not be a good movie - O.K., it's a terrible movie - but it might nonetheless be a movie that feels good to see, whether you squirm or giggle or roll your eyes or just sit still and take your punishment."
258,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"To her credit, Taylor-Johnson proves that graphic images are not needed and this is the first mainstream Hollywood film that successfully shows female pleasure in bondage scenes. Unfortunately, we have to wade through an awful lot that is trite."
259,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Fifty Shades of Grey is an entertaining, witty, and yes occasionally sexy fable of female assertiveness disguised as a tale of submission."
260,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Maybe the smoulderingly sado-obsessed hero does not have a penis. It could account for his tastes. And his decor.
261,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Jamie Dornan somehow manages to render his sculpted beauty moot, which throws a major wrench in the gears for a film dependent on eroticism."
262,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"It's no Clint Eastwood's superheroic saving of 'The Bridges of Madison County,' but it'll do."
263,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"We may have all been curious going in, but by the time the credits roll, there's another question that springs to mind: Is that all there is?"
264,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Despite the endless sex, a highly unsatisfying encounter. Cold as a fish and almost as dumb."
265,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Fifty Shades of Grey is not the lame, hot-and-bothered fantasy romance many, including myself, thought it would be. It's got wit and humor and a modest intelligence about human behavior that, say, the Twilight movies never had."
266,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"The movie Fifty Shades of Grey is considerably better written than the book. It is also sort of classy-looking, in a generic, TV-ad-for-bath-oil way."
267,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,Sitting through the turgid and tedious S&M melodrama that is Fifty Shades of Grey may feel like its own form of torture.
268,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"""Fifty Shades Of Grey"" is embarrassing and depressing, especially when considering the picture as a reflection of the quality and state of mainstream modern romance today."
269,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"""The stylish and mostly satisfying film will be [a blockbuster], and deservedly so. Starring a vivacious Dakota Johnson and a game Jamie Dornan, Taylor-Johnson's erotic romance is a skillful distillation of James' first book."""
270,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"After the reams of commentary EL James' books have inspired (and recent faith-based protests) this big screen adaptation still manages to be about people, and even a little bit sweet."
271,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"Lacks any of the raunch or controversy promised, and is instead tiresome, banal and as thinly plotted as a porno."
272,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,"The fine line between abuse and pleasure is so thin it's almost non-existent. Here is a Valentine's Day movie that will certainly make bank, but you aren't helping yourself or anyone else by seeing it."
273,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Gone are the truly dreadful aspects of the book, and the biggest surprise may be that Ana and Christian have developed senses of humor."
274,fifty_shades_of_grey,NEGATIVE,No amount of polished technical ingredients can salvage a relatively faithful screenplay that lifts much of the book's painfully rudimentary dialogue verbatim.
275,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Glossy, well cast, and a consistent hoot until it becomes a serious drag."
276,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Accept this genuinely sexy, somewhat silly, relatively timid romantic drama on its own escapist terms and you'll find sufficient pleasure."
277,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Fifty Shades of Grey is a sex-positive but hopelessly soft-core erotic drama that fails to be even a fraction as titillating as the E.L. James books that inspired it. And yet, that's exactly why it works."
278,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Aiming to please, the filmmakers submit without hesitation to the bold yet hokey source material, with leads Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson breathing a crucial third dimension into cutout characters."
279,fifty_shades_of_grey,POSITIVE,"Johnson is a true find: She's so committed, she makes Ana's every discovery - in or out of the bedroom - convincing."
